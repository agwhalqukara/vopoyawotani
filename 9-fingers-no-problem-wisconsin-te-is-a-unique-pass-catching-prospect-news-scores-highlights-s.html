He hasn't had it since he was two days old.</p><p><span>Fumagalli was born with amniotic band syndrome, where the umbilical cord connecting him to his mother was wrapped around his left hand. It cut off circulation to his hand, and he was lucky not to have lost more than one finger—or the entire hand.</span></p><p>But he still runs better than any tight end in April's NFL draft, still blocks better, still gets open and separates, still uses his body to shield defenders. You know, all of that scout stuff.</p><p>Now, understand this: No one in college football—and no one in the 2018 draft—catches the ball better. At any position.</p><p>"And no one has for a couple of years," Wisconsin head football coach Paul Chryst said.</p><p>So please, NFL personnel, don't waste your time and money with medical background checks or psychological profiles. (As a boy, Fumagalli chose to be left-hand dominant.)</p><p>Just do what every scout for every NFL team does: bet your job on game tape.</p><p>"Turn on the tape, it doesn't lie—ever. I guarantee you it doesn't with [Fumagalli]," one NFC scout told Bleacher Report. "But I'm telling you right now, I've heard guys. We travel together, we talk. There are guys out there who truly think there's something wrong, and for some reason they can't explain, four fingers isn't as good as five."</p><p>To this, Fumagalli said, "If I had that [index] finger, it would almost be in the way."</p><p>Of course it would. Because when all you've known in life is a left hand with four fingers, you adapt and evolve. You live each day proving not only can you do anything that someone with five fingers can, you can do it better.</p><p>You prove that when someone tells you to throw a football, you use your middle finger as the balance finger and the ball comes off your hand just fine, thank you.</p><p>You prove that when your high school coach needs a pitcher who can get someone out, you throw a curve with your middle finger, and it has a nasty break. And it gets outs.</p><p>You prove that despite an impressive high school football career, you aren't the guy everyone overlooked for one reason or another (take one guess why), the one who decided to walk on at Wisconsin because the Badgers' overachieving, hard-working, results-producing culture fit perfectly with the player you were and wanted to be moving forward.</p><p>"If ever there were a Wisconsin guy, Troy was it," former Badgers head coach <a href=#>Bret Bielema</a> said.</p><img alt="PROVO, UT - SEPTEMBER 16: Troy Fumagalli #81 of the Wisconsin Badgers runs into the end zone untouched for a second half touchdown as the Badgers beat the Brigham Young Cougars 40-6 at LaVell Edwards Stadium on September 16, 2017 in Provo, Utah.

His missing index finger is the only thing missing from the conversation.</p><p>Those NFL scouts and their physical and psychological checklists will soon figure it out, after Fumagalli plays his final college game Saturday in the Orange Bowl against Miami and begins to schedule individual workouts and interviews with teams. They see the tape; it doesn't lie.</p><p>One scout told Bleacher Report that Fumagalli compares favorably to Patriots Pro Bowler Rob Gronkowski; another said he's more like Jordan Reed or Travis Kelce. While most scouts agree the 6'6", 248-pound Fumagalli needs to gain 15-20 pounds to grow into the position in the NFL, he's being compared to three of the league's best tight ends over the last decade.</p><p>Yet when the interviews begin<span>—</span>when NFL personnel start to dig deep into a player they might want to spend a first-round pick on<span>—</span>the inevitable will come back in full force.</p><p>"I have a hard time thinking that they can turn [no index finger] into a big deal all of a sudden," Fumagalli said. "I've been doing things on and off the field all my life. Let me know what you want me to do, and I can do it. That's what I'm going to say."</p><p>Now you know why Fumagalli chose Wisconsin, why he flourished in the program that annually gets little respect yet continues to churn out successful seasons. Doesn't matter the coach—Barry Alvarez, Bielema, Andersen, Chryst—the Badgers win and make believers every year.</p><img alt="ARLINGTON, TX - JANUARY 02: Troy Fumagalli #81 of the Wisconsin Badgers celebrates after a 24-16 win against the Western Michigan Broncos during the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic at AT&T Stadium on January 2, 2017 in Arlington, Texas.

Saturday's Orange Bowl will be its 10th&nbsp;New Year's Day bowl in those 13 seasons.</p><p>Fumagalli, meanwhile, is just the latest overachieving star in a program full of them. He isn't&nbsp;putting up electrifying numbers<span>—</span>what tight end in college does?<span>—</span>but he's consistently the safest, surest target on the field, a player who wins individual battles against linebackers and safeties.</p><p>There is no greater indicator of a tight end's ability to wreak havoc than when a defense uses a cornerback in coverage—or when he is double-covered.</p><p>"Wisconsin is a little limited in the passing game, and if you're doubling the one guy who can get open and catch the ball, he's going to have a hard time putting up 'wow' numbers," one AFC scout told Bleacher Report. "But it's so much more than numbers."</p><p>Just like it's so much more than one finger.</p><p>But what he has gained in perspective and perseverance is more useful than a finger he hasn't needed, anyway.</p><p>"It's all I've known my entire life," Fumagalli said. "I haven't found anything in my life that I haven't been able to do without it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaXBtYG2CcXmYZp2ippeav7R5zahkqaqfl7mmuYywoKybn6PAqrqMrZxmoaNirm7BzaKorp1dpa60v4ycmK2bmJ67qHnPq6asqJWYwQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./carson-daly-baby-daughter-fiancee-siri-pinter-gives-birth-to-london.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Carson Daly Baby Daughter: Fiancee Siri Pinter Gives Birth to London</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./worker-lives-matter-campaign-challenges-grueling-996-corporate-culture-in-china.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Worker Lives Matter campaign challenges grueling 996 corporate culture in China</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-former-assistant-felicia-culotta-shares-thoughts-on-her-boyfriend-sam-asghari.html>Britney Spears' Former Assistant Felicia Culotta Shares Thoughts on Her Boyfriend Sam Asghari</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-season-pass-gets-you-an-extra-multiplayer-map-at-launch.html>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's season pass gets you an extra multiplayer map at launch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-lawrence-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-wiki.html>Charlotte Lawrence - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dakota-johnson-finally-opens-up-what-it-was-like-to-make-fifty-shades-of-grey-spoiler-alert-it-wasn.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog.
