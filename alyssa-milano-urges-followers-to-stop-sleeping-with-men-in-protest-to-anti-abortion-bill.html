The actress urged her fellow women and female rights activists to stop having s*x with men as a way of encouraging them to cancel looming anti-abortion legislation.</p><p>Reportedly, there are anti-abortion bills coming to the House of Representatives, and politically minded entertainers such as Alyssa are clamoring for women to stop sleeping with men as a way of convincing them of Republican wrong-doing.</p><p>On Friday, the star claimed “our reproductive rights are being erased,” before going on to say that, “until women have legal control over our bodies we just cannot risk pregnancy.” Milano urged her followers to join her in sexual abstinence.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/Bw-e8NCAxhh/</p><p>Alyssa’s tweet came after legislation was introduced in Georgia, as well as in states like Alabama and Ohio. Page Six reported that Alyssa’s tweet gathered approximately 10,000 likes and 4,000 re-tweets over-night. Early Saturday morning, Alyssa’s tweet supposedly was trending.</p><p>Milano is known mostly for her activism as of late, rather than her acting career, which she claims was hindered by producer Harvey Weinstein. The ex-Miramax producer was accused of using his position in Hollywood to get s*x from women who wanted movie and television roles. He allegedly used the very same power to thwart their careers had they refused his offers.</p><p>Mr. Weinstein’s case was supposed to go on trial this month – in May, however – it was postponed later this year. Another performer to go on the defensive soon following #MeToo allegations is the R & B singer, R. Kelly, who was outed as a sexual predator once again following the airing of Surviving R. Kelly on Lifetime.</p><p>R. Kelly later appeared on CBS This Morning with Gayle King, where he sat down with the news anchor and insisted that he didn’t do any of the things he was accused of, including “hog-tying women.”</p><p>The singer claimed such an allegation was preposterous, considering, in his own words, he doesn’t even know how to hog-tie someone. Moreover, Michael Avenatti claims to have in his possession yet another tape of the controversial singer sleeping with an underaged girl.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Since allegations against men such as Weinstein and Kelly have come about, celebrity activists have started many different campaigns, including Time’s Up, a group dedicated to gender equality in the entertainment business. The aforementioned Milano is one of its most vocal supporters.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRoca0v8BmpKKkkaO8bsHRoJysZZakua271p6prGWkpHq0wM6pZKyklZq9qrrGZq6irJhiuqa6jKKlZqiipMGmv9Nmq6hlkaPBqnnAm6arrJmku26uyKWjZmpoZoF1fY4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./frankenstein-s-assistant-in-movies.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Frankenstein's assistant in movies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./yankees-legend-derek-jeter-wife-hannah-welcome-newborn-baby-boy-kaius-green-news-scores-highlig.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Yankees Legend Derek Jeter, Wife Hannah Welcome Newborn Baby Boy Kaius Green | News, Scores, Highlig</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-former-assistant-felicia-culotta-shares-thoughts-on-her-boyfriend-sam-asghari.html>Britney Spears' Former Assistant Felicia Culotta Shares Thoughts on Her Boyfriend Sam Asghari</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-season-pass-gets-you-an-extra-multiplayer-map-at-launch.html>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's season pass gets you an extra multiplayer map at launch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-lawrence-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-wiki.html>Charlotte Lawrence - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dakota-johnson-finally-opens-up-what-it-was-like-to-make-fifty-shades-of-grey-spoiler-alert-it-wasn.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog.
