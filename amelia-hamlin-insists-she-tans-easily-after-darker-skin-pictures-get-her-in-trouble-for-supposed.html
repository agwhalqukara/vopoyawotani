However, according to her, there was never any intention of pretending to be Black or anything like that.</p><p>Instead, Amelia Hamlin took to her platform to respond to critics, telling them that she simply tans really easily.</p><p>It all started with the post that featured three pics of the 19 year old posing for the camera.</p><p>In the caption, she wrote: ‘Whiplash got me…..’</p><p>View this post on Instagram</p><p>A post shared by Amelia (@ameliagray)</p><p>Sure enough, Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin’s daughter looked pretty different from how she usually looks, mainly because her complexion was a few shades darker!</p><p>While the post’s comments are turned off, it sounds like many took to her DMs to drag her for ‘blackfishing.’</p><p>This term refers to a light skinned person darkening their skin and texturing or styling their hair in a way that would make others believe they might be black or at least of an ambiguous mixed race.</p><p>Judging by the fact that Scott Disick’s girlfriend decided to respond, the hate in her DMs must have been a lot.</p><p>She wrote: ‘I’m receiving a lot of comments in regards to my latest photo. I am being told that I am ‘black fishing’ – thank you all for educating me on this topic. I recently went on vacation to the sun, and with my Italian heritage, I tan very easily. There is no self-tanner involved. Or intention of looking any darker than my own skin color. I just had a lot of fun creating this look with no malice intention or offense.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>You might know that blackfishing is considered a part of cultural appropriation and many celebs have been accused of it, including Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez and pretty much all of the Kardashians.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeRorKttcBmn5qlnJ67brXNrKCsrKNiwKmxjK2Yp6tdmq60tcuyZJqepJq%2FbrDAq6Keql2ouKq6jKmgnKylp7K0ecaeq2aglad6qrqMramorZKhsm6yzqtkrK2gpby0scNmmaWZk6Czqr%2FHoqWgZWRshXd8lmg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cast-release-date-plot-episodes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cast, Release Date, Plot, Episodes!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./80-worst-pick-up-lines-you-should-never-ever-use-if-you-want-to-bag-someone.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>80 worst pick up lines you should never, ever use if you want to bag someone</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-former-assistant-felicia-culotta-shares-thoughts-on-her-boyfriend-sam-asghari.html>Britney Spears' Former Assistant Felicia Culotta Shares Thoughts on Her Boyfriend Sam Asghari</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-season-pass-gets-you-an-extra-multiplayer-map-at-launch.html>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's season pass gets you an extra multiplayer map at launch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-lawrence-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-wiki.html>Charlotte Lawrence - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dakota-johnson-finally-opens-up-what-it-was-like-to-make-fifty-shades-of-grey-spoiler-alert-it-wasn.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog.
