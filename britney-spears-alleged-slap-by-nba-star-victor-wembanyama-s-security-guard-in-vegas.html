Spears has recounted the events of the evening when she claims to have been<a href=#> slapped by a security guard</a> employed by NBA player Victor Wembanyama at Catch restaurant in Las Vegas.</p><p>In her<a href=#> Instagram Stories post on July 6</a>, the pop star acknowledged her familiarity with distressing incidents, stating that she was unprepared for what unfolded that night.</p><p>She explained that while she was making her way to dinner through the hotel lobby, she noticed an athlete whom she recognized.</p><p>Later, at a different hotel’s restaurant, she encountered the same individual once again.</p><p>According to Britney, the alleged assault occurred when the athlete’s security guard struck her on the face without turning back, in front of a crowd.</p><p>The force of the blow nearly caused her to stumble and sent her glasses flying off her face.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/een8jo53vqo.exactdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Britney-Spears-slap.png><p>The 41-year-old expressed her desire for a public<a href=#> apology from Victor</a> and his team.</p><h2><span id=What_happened_in_Vegas>What happened in Vegas?</span></h2><p>In her Story, she thanked her fans and expressed her gratitude for the overwhelming love and support she has been receiving.</p><p>She also acknowledged and appreciated the support of the Las Vegas PD and the detectives.</p><p>On the other hand, Victor shared his side of the story, stating that he did not witness the alleged assault.</p><p>According to him, there was someone calling his name, but he had been advised by security not to stop to avoid attracting a crowd.</p><p>He mentioned that this person grabbed him from behind, and as a result, he did not see what had transpired because he was walking straight as instructed.</p><p>Additionally, Victor admitted that he was initially unaware of Britney’s involvement in the incident.</p><p>It was only when he returned to the hotel that the security personnel of the Spurs informed him that it was Britney Spears.</p><p>He clarified that he never saw her face, and he simply continued walking without realizing who was involved.</p><h2><span id=Britneys_husband_Sam_Asghari_Statement>Britney’s husband, Sam Asghari Statement</span></h2><p>In the midst of the situation, Britney’s husband, <a href=#>Sam Asghari</a>, issued a statement defending his wife.</p><p>He expressed his opposition to violence and emphasized the importance of self-defense for those unable to protect themselves.</p><p>However, he believed that the alleged reaction in this particular case was not justified.</p><p>Sam expressed his hope for the individual involved to learn from this incident and change their attitude towards women.</p><p>He thanked those who supported Britney and clarified that he didn’t want the blame to fall on Victor, but rather on the security guard, the hiring process, and the culture of disregard for women in sports and entertainment.</p><p>Sam emphasized that he couldn’t fathom a scenario where a female fan expressing excitement or appreciation would result in physical assault.</p><p>He called for systemic changes and looked forward to seeing them implemented.</p><p>Following the incident, Britney filed a police report, and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department confirmed the investigation without any arrests or citations issued.</p><p>Efforts to obtain comments from Britney, Sam, and Victor’s representatives have been unsuccessful.</p><h3><span id=ALSO_READ_Casino_Jizzle_Death_What_Happened_to_Casino_Jizzle>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Casino Jizzle Death: What Happened to Casino
