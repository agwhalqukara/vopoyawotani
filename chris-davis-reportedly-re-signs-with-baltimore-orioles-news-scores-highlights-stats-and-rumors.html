According to an industry source, a high-ranking official from the club spoke to agent Scott Boras over the phone a few days ago in the latest attempt to seal the deal.<br>The offer is off the table, as executive vice president Dan Duquette confirmed at FanFest, but the Orioles aren't cutting off the lines of communication. They want Davis in their lineup and still have the funds.</p><p>However, ESPN's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buster Olney</a> noted agent Scott Boras has been calling teams about Davis, although he added the Orioles were among those contacted.&nbsp;</p><p><span>The site continued: "<span>It's possible the talks will resume where they last left off—the two sides spoke as recently as Wednesday—but one source said the Orioles are going about the business of remaking the team for 2016, whether it includes Davis or not, and pursuing other players."</span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Fox Sports'&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ken&nbsp;Rosenthal</a><span>&nbsp;reported Thursday morning the Orioles had put in another bid for "possibly as high as [$168 million for seven years]."&nbsp;</span>Rosenthal<span>&nbsp;noted the Orioles are "</span><span>hopeful, even somewhat optimistic, that [they] can strike [a] deal."</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>However, Olney reported "<span>the Orioles didn't raise the offer—'not a nickel'—since Wednesday, before deciding to pull it back."</span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubatk</a><span>reported no progress was made when the Orioles met&nbsp;</span>Boras<span>, on Tuesday, and he noted that the team's offer was believed to be in the $150 million range.</span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olney</a>&nbsp;confirmed the $150 million mark Wednesday, adding the offer was for seven years.&nbsp;</p><p>On Nov. 28,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dan Connolly</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Baltimore Sun&nbsp;reported that while the Orioles can't afford to pay Davis as much as some other clubs can, they hope to keep the slugger:</p><p>According to sources, the Orioles ultimately don’t believe they’ll be the highest bidder for Davis, who is 29 and has hit more homers than any other major leaguer in the past four years. One source said that the organization would not be comfortable agreeing to a $150 to $175 million deal with Davis, which seems like it could be the market range.</p><p>Yet sources also say the Orioles believe they have a fighting chance to retain Davis -- and that’s where the hometown discount will have to come in.</p><p>Key members of the Orioles’ brass have said -- on and off the record -- they believe their offers to Davis will be competitive with his ultimate market value. Maybe not top dollar, but close enough to make him think hard about a return.</p><p><h2 class=streamElement>Boras Comments on Davis' Future</h2></p><p><h3 class=streamElement>Monday, Dec. 14</h3></p><p><span>"We are talking to a number of teams, Baltimore included," Davis' agent, Scott Boras, told Fox Sports' <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jon Morosi</a>.</span></p><p><h2 class=streamElement><span>Davis' Demands Reportedly Surface</span></h2></p><p><h3 class=streamElement><span>Wednesday, Dec. 9</span></h3></p><p>"While Davis' exact target isn't known, he is believed to be seeking something closer to a $200 million deal, or more, and while that sounds like a significant gap, both sides are staying close in touch," reported&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Heyman</a>, who continued:</p><p>There seems to be motivation on both sides to bridge the gap, and they continue to work.</p><p>Davis' camp is believed to have in mind a longer deal, with comps that include Mark Teixeira's $180-million, eight-year Yankees deal, Prince Fielder's nine-year, $214-million Tigers deal and Joey Votto's $10-year, $225-million Reds deal. As for the Orioles, they have never given more than a $88.5 million deal in their history, which went to star center fielder Adam Jones.</p><p><h2 class=streamElement>Davis Reportedly Not Cardinals' Top Priority</h2></p><p><h3 class=streamElement>Tuesday, Dec. 1</h3></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry Crasnick</a> of ESPN reported talk of St. Louis' interest in Davis is "overblown."</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Morosi</a>&nbsp;on Nov. 20, the St. Louis Cardinals "have had discussions" with Boras recently.</p><p>Morosi adds the Cardinals "are intrigued by Davis' ability to play first base, third base, right field and left field." The 29-year-old has primarily played first base and DH in recent years, but he did play right field more in 2015, including a 16-game streak from June 30-July 22.</p><p>The Cardinals, who won 100 games during the regular season before getting eliminated by the Chicago Cubs in the National League Division Series, certainly understand the value of depth and versatility after key offensive players like Matt Adams and Matt Holliday missed a combined 191 games last year.</p><p>While traditionally not big spenders in free agency, the Cardinals need to bolster an offense that finished 24th in runs scored last year and is facing the possibility of losing Jason Heyward to free agency. Morosi's report notes the team will be willing to invest "heavily" thanks to additional revenue from a new local television deal.</p><p><h2 class=streamElement>Red Sox Considering Davis</h2></p><p><h3 class=streamElement>Sunday, Nov. 29</h3></p><p>"<span>The Red Sox have at least discussed Davis internally, though any advancement would be tied into being able to deal [Hanley Ramirez] and the amount of resources expended on the ace pitcher," reported <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nick Cafardo</a> of the&nbsp;Boston Globe.</span></p><p><h2 class=streamElement>What Davis will Bring to Next Team</h2></p><p><span>Davis has his limitations as a hitter, striking out 208 times in 2015, but he hit 53 homers in 2013 and 47 in 2015 for the Baltimore Orioles. He's a patient hitter who has posted on-base percentage totals over .360 two of the last three years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Power is a precious commodity in MLB with pitching and defense ruling the sport at this moment. Davis isn't a flawless player, but at just 29 years old with two very successful seasons in the last three years, he's got a lot of upside for the O's, who need his bat in the lineup.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW5xYWl9dHnCoamiq12Zrre10majmqyVqMFuusSwqmaqpaK8s7%2BMrKeem6WhrrW1zqdkrK2ip7y2usOipaBllqeypnnAoJynrF1mrw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./destination-for-nasa-s-artemis-program.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Destination for NASA's Artemis program</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./checkra1n-0-9-2-beta-latest-version-free-download-for-windows-macos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Checkra1n 0.9.2 Beta Latest Version Free Download For Windows &amp;amp; MacOs</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-former-assistant-felicia-culotta-shares-thoughts-on-her-boyfriend-sam-asghari.html>Britney Spears' Former Assistant Felicia Culotta Shares Thoughts on Her Boyfriend Sam Asghari</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-season-pass-gets-you-an-extra-multiplayer-map-at-launch.html>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's season pass gets you an extra multiplayer map at launch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-lawrence-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-wiki.html>Charlotte Lawrence - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dakota-johnson-finally-opens-up-what-it-was-like-to-make-fifty-shades-of-grey-spoiler-alert-it-wasn.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog.
