Callie said it best tonight: Life changes in an instant. Turns on a dime." she <a href=#>wrote</a>. "This finale was incredibly hard to write. I did not enjoy it. It made me sick and it made me sad. We end the season not knowing anything about the future. Except for two things. We know we are definitely saying goodbye to two of my favorite people: Chyler Leigh (Lexie) and Kim Raver<strong> </strong>(Teddy)."</p><p>Indeed, during the episode, Leigh and Raver made their exit — via death and job changes. Following the devastating plane crash, Lexie's body was crushed under the wreckage and she died after an emotional farewell to Mark (<strong>Eric Dane</strong>). Teddy was fired by Owen in order for her to accept a position at a military hospital.</p><p>"I know this season's finale had some surprises for viewers and the exit of Kim Raver was one of the big ones," Rhimes continued. "But Kim's series option was up and she was ready to give Teddy Altman a much-needed vacation. It's been a pleasure working with someone as talented and funny and kind as Kim; everyone is going to miss her terribly. I like to imagine that Teddy is still out there in the Grey's Anatomy universe, running Army Medical Command and building a new life."</p><p>"I love Chyler and I love the character of Lexie Grey," she added. "She was an important member of my Grey's family. This was not an easy decision. But it was a decision that Chyler and I came to together. We had a lot of thoughtful discussion about it and ultimately we both decided this was the right time for her character's journey to end. As far as I'm concerned Chyler will always remain a part of the Shondaland family and I can't wait to work with her again in the future."</p><p>And Rhimes is just as sad as fans about the decision.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I'd write more but I'm honestly too sad," the creator wrote. "I don't like life changing in an instant and turning on a dime. Thanks for watching Season Eight. We are, as always, grateful that you joined us for the ride."</p><p>Raver took to her own <a href=#>Twitter</a> account to write a personal farewell. "I've had one of the best times of my creative career working on Grey's with Shonda, Betsy and the best cast on Television," she tweeted. "I feel fortunate and grateful to have worked with such an amazing team at GA. i am going to miss everyone!! And to the GA fans, you guys rock! I am sure S9 will be great!"</p><p>Tell Us: Were you upset by the season eight finale of Grey's Anatomy?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJqhsZyav264xKKeoWWbnrpuvsCvnKtlnJqut7GMoKmesaNirq%2Bt06iksmViZX5zfZdu</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kenya-moore-gushes-over-her-amazonian-bombshell-sister-see-the-gorgeous-photo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kenya Moore Gushes Over Her Amazonian Bombshell Sister See The Gorgeous Photo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./brian-may-teams-up-with-kings-daughters-for-charity-single.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Brian May Teams Up With Kings Daughters For Charity Single</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-former-assistant-felicia-culotta-shares-thoughts-on-her-boyfriend-sam-asghari.html>Britney Spears' Former Assistant Felicia Culotta Shares Thoughts on Her Boyfriend Sam Asghari</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-season-pass-gets-you-an-extra-multiplayer-map-at-launch.html>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's season pass gets you an extra multiplayer map at launch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-lawrence-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-wiki.html>Charlotte Lawrence - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dakota-johnson-finally-opens-up-what-it-was-like-to-make-fifty-shades-of-grey-spoiler-alert-it-wasn.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog.
