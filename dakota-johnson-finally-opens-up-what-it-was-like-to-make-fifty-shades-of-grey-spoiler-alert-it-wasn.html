Dakota has admitted that the movie-making process was very difficult and primarily because of the heavy disagreements between the studio, the directors, and the author of the books, Erika Leonard, who goes by the pen name E.L. James.</p><p>Dakota said that she has never been able to reveal the truth about all this because obviously, you cannot badmouth a franchise while it is in active promotion stages, but fans have historically noted Dakota’s discomfort in interviews regarding the movie.</p><p>Dakota revealed that the author of the book, James, was given a lot of creative power in the movie-making process and that she demanded a lot of things to be put in the movie which seasoned directors understood wouldn’t benefit the movie at all.</p><p>“There were parts of the books that just wouldn’t work in a movie, like the inner monologue, which was at times incredibly cheesy. It wouldn’t work to say out loud. It was always a battle. Always,” said Dakota.</p><p>Dakota also revealed that when Charlie Hunnam, who was originally cast to play Christian Grey dropped out due to scheduling conflicts, James was so distraught that she completely abandoned the original script of the movie and the movie that was eventually created with Jamie Dornan was a completely different version of the movie, in which Dakota and the rest of the crew desperately tried to keep some essence of the previous script.</p><p>“We’d do the takes of the movie that Erika wanted to make, and then we would do the takes of the movie that we wanted to make. The night before, I would rewrite scenes with the old dialogue so I could add a line here and there. It was like mayhem all the time,” said Johnson.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Dakota said that if anyone knew what it was going to be like on set they would not want to be a part of the movie but still she has no regrets about joining the project.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUlriwwMBmoaignqi8r3nFoqWapJyuerC8xKeqZq2gYsSprdNmoK1lp5bAbrjIpJxmrJ9iuqK3xGadop6krnq0tMCdnKxln5t6qL7EsmSsqJ%2Beuaa%2BjJqjnqqkYra1edaaqqesXZy%2Fpq3TZmxrbWVrgXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andre-muniz-breaks-ronaldo-jacare-souza-s-arm-to-score-win-by-submission-at-ufc-262.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andre Muniz breaks Ronaldo Jacare Souzas arm to score win by submission at UFC 262</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-former-assistant-felicia-culotta-shares-thoughts-on-her-boyfriend-sam-asghari.html>Britney Spears' Former Assistant Felicia Culotta Shares Thoughts on Her Boyfriend Sam Asghari</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-season-pass-gets-you-an-extra-multiplayer-map-at-launch.html>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's season pass gets you an extra multiplayer map at launch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-lawrence-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-wiki.html>Charlotte Lawrence - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dakota-johnson-finally-opens-up-what-it-was-like-to-make-fifty-shades-of-grey-spoiler-alert-it-wasn.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog.
