He is once again being suggested for an Academy Award for his role in The Danish Girl, in which he takes the role of Einar Wegener/Lili Elbe. In December 2014, Eddie married his sweetheart, Hannah Bagshawe and they celebrated their first anniversary earlier in December 2015.&nbsp;But the good news doesn’t stop there for Eddie. It is rumoured that Eddie and Hannah are expecting their first child!</p><p>The report came in a few days after their anniversary and was reported by ‘The Sun.”</p><p>The paper wrote that their baby is due in June and wrote that Hannah and Eddie,</p><p>“Are delighted and extremely excited. They don’t want to find out the sex of the baby but are happy to tell close friends and family they are expecting”</p><p>Eddie earlier commented on his marriage to Hannah, describing it as a “most wonderful whirlwind.”</p><p>The two lovebirds met at Eton College London, where they both studied. After meeting at a charity event, in which Eddie modelled in, they both became friends. Hannah went on to do a Masters degree in English literature and French while Eddie studied History of Art at Trinity College Cambridge. The two then furthered their relationship and in January 2012, the became official. Their first red carpet appearance was at the London premier of Les Miserables. The couple then tied the knot December last year.</p><p>FUN FACTS:</p><ul><li>Hannah and Eddie were engaged over Memorial Day weekend 2014.</li><li>Hannah was late to her own wedding! Eddie said while on the Ellen show, “My wife has never been on time for anything in her life. She was a good half-hour late.”</li><li>They spent their honeymoon in the alps, even though it was cut short due to Eddie’s many nominations- the troubles of being one of the best actors in the world. Eddie described his honeymoon, stating, “We went skiing over Christmas. We went to the Alps, which was a beautiful idea, but unfortunately, there was no snow. But that was just an excuse to take long lunches, drink a lot of red wine, and have a lot of fondue.” (queue “awww”)</li></ul><p>Watch the interview here:</p><p></p><p>It’s a given, Eddie and Hannah make a beautiful couple and we wish them the best of luck and send them many congratulations for their heart warming news!</p><p>Comment or tweet <a href=#>@CelebMix</a>, your reaction to this fabulous news.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksqWwyJ5koZmeo66pedGem6aZqaOybrrEsKpo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./helo%C3%ADsa-pinheiro-bio-age-net-worth-height-married-nationality-career.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Helosa Pinheiro- Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Married, Nationality, Career</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carol-ann-susi-big-bang-theory-actress-dead-at-62.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carol Ann Susi, Big Bang Theory Actress, Dead at 62</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-former-assistant-felicia-culotta-shares-thoughts-on-her-boyfriend-sam-asghari.html>Britney Spears' Former Assistant Felicia Culotta Shares Thoughts on Her Boyfriend Sam Asghari</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-season-pass-gets-you-an-extra-multiplayer-map-at-launch.html>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's season pass gets you an extra multiplayer map at launch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-lawrence-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-wiki.html>Charlotte Lawrence - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dakota-johnson-finally-opens-up-what-it-was-like-to-make-fifty-shades-of-grey-spoiler-alert-it-wasn.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog.
