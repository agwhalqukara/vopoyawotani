On Sunday, December 17, with his family by his side at his Chapel Hill residence, Montross, a legendary figure known for his time with the North Carolina basketball program, died of cancer. The legacy of UNC basketball will never be the same without Eric Montross.</p><p>Montross was an integral cog in the Tar Heel machine, and he was a legendary figure both on and off the court. He got his start in the NBA from 1990–1994, when he was a key contributor for coach Dean Smith. His outstanding talent was on full display during the 1993 NCAA Championship-winning team, which led to numerous accolades for him, including a spot on the John Wooden All-America team.</p><p>Even after his basketball career ended, Montross maintained ties to the school and its alumni. He was a beloved figure to Tar Heel Sports Network viewers for 18 seasons as he shared his knowledge, enthusiasm, and humor with them. Because Montross fought for causes he believed in, his influence went well beyond the basketball world. Reflecting his commitment to making a significant impact on people’s lives, he actively supported the Lineberger Center’s fight against cancer.</p><p>In a touching tribute, Carolina Athletics remembered Montross for all he did as a dedicated family man, friend, and community leader. In it, Montross expressed the feelings of the many people whose lives he touched with his hospitality, generosity, and genuine kindness. Thanks to everyone who showed their support during Eric’s brave fight with cancer, the Montross family was able to release a statement expressing their gratitude.</p><p>They asked for privacy at this difficult time to pay tribute to a man whose grace and unfaltering resolve touched many lives. Many will always remember Eric Montross for the profound influence he had on the University of North Carolina basketball team and the campus community. Big Grits, may you rest in peace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiao5x7prDUZ62nZ5WntqR5zKilraqfqMBuu8Giq66Zoq56trrCZpmaq5uawaOty6Vkm6GUYrOivsSwnKWkXam8bq2MpZygnZ6Zeri0zmabop2UYq61eZRrZJ2dkam1bsDHnmSwp6KhsW67waKrrGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fans-outraged-at-audrey-roloff-for-endangering-her-children.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fans Outraged At Audrey Roloff For Endangering Her Children</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-mark-davis-wife-all-about-the-raiders-owner-and-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Mark Davis' wife?
