Everything that I need is there at the house. The decision was made since this level of football is stressful for a rookie, especially from the quarterback position. There is a lot going on, a lot of meetings. So everything outside of football is handled by my family.</i></p><p><i>"I don't have to worry about laundry, what I'm eating for dinner, chicken cutlets and all that is waiting for me when I get there. My mom still makes my bed. Everything is handled for me. Honestly, I don't even know if I could find a place closer to here than where I live. It takes me 12 minutes to get here."</i></p><p>DeVito, who played his high school football at Don Bosco Prep in Ramsey, New Jersey, before playing collegiately at Syracuse and Illinois, lives just nine miles away from the Giants' practice facility and MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.</p><p>The 25-year-old DeVito signed with the Giants as an undrafted free agent, and after beginning the season on the practice squad, he was recently pressed into action.</p><p>With starter Daniel Jones out due to injury, DeVito served as the backup to Tyrod Taylor against the New York Jets in Week 8, and he replaced Taylor when the veteran got injured.</p><p>DeVito's first NFL game was a struggle, as he went just 2-of-7 for -1 yard, although he did rush for 12 yards and a touchdown on four carries in a 13-10 overtime loss.</p><p>The following week, DeVito was the backup again, as Taylor was placed on injured reserve and Jones returned to start.</p><p>Jones suffered a season-ending torn ACL during last week's game against the Las Vegas Raiders, though, which resulted in DeVito playing most of the game.</p><p>Although the Giants lost 30-6, DeVito looked far more comfortable, going 15-of-20 for 175 yards with one touchdown and two interceptions.</p><p>Since both Jones and Taylor are now on IR, DeVito will start against the NFC East rival Cowboys on Sunday, and he could start the next three games until Taylor is eligible to come off IR.</p><p>Given DeVito's lack of experience, the Giants are unsurprisingly huge road underdogs against Dallas, but a strong performance could help him solidify a spot with the G-Men or another organization moving forward.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaWuGcoOMoKCapqSoerKujK2mpqWpYrGmwsitpmarka7AbrTEZqqtoZyheq211Z6qZq%2BZqbVuvMCrnKeso2K6unnMqKRmq6Seua15zJqinqtdosZursSd</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gwyneth-paltrow-s-goop-tips-for-a-pain-free-pregnancy-details.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Tips for a Pain-Free Pregnancy: Details</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bryan-lanning-net-worth-bio-age-girlfriend-height-songs-career.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bryan Lanning- Net Worth, Bio, Age, Girlfriend, Height, Songs, Career</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-former-assistant-felicia-culotta-shares-thoughts-on-her-boyfriend-sam-asghari.html>Britney Spears' Former Assistant Felicia Culotta Shares Thoughts on Her Boyfriend Sam Asghari</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-season-pass-gets-you-an-extra-multiplayer-map-at-launch.html>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's season pass gets you an extra multiplayer map at launch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-lawrence-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-wiki.html>Charlotte Lawrence - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dakota-johnson-finally-opens-up-what-it-was-like-to-make-fifty-shades-of-grey-spoiler-alert-it-wasn.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog.
