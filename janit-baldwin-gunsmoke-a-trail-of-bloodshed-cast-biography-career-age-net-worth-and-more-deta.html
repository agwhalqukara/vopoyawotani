Age And Five Facts To Know About Her</a></span></strong></p><h2>Janit Baldwin: Details About The Gunsmoke A Trail of Bloodshed Actress</h2><p>In the 1947 episode of Gunsmoke titled “A Trail of Bloodshed,” Janit Baldwin portrays the character Joanie Brody.</p><p>The parts of Claudia Jennings’s adorable younger sister in the exhilarating redneck drive-in exploitation classic ‘Gator Bait’ are among her most well-known cinematic appearances (1973). In the film, she is portrayed as the character Julie.</p><p>The story follows Desiree, who together with her siblings lives in a swampy location and is forced to rely on illegal hunting to provide for their survival. When Ben and deputy Billy spot Desiree catching alligators, they decide to go after her in the hopes of receiving some solace from the so-called “Cajun swamp rat.”</p><p>In addition, Janit may be seen playing the role of a groupie in Brian De Palma’s Phantom of the Paradise, which is a delightfully crazy horror rock satire (1974). The story revolves around a musician and composer who suffers a disfiguring accident and offers his soul to the woman he loves on the condition that she perform his music. On the other hand, a nefarious record magnate betrays him and exploits his songs to open up his rock castle, which he calls The Paradise.</p><p>In the horrific made-for-television movie Born Innocent, which is about teenage females serving time in prison, Janit portrayed the part of a hardened juvenile offender (1974).</p><p>It tells the story of a young girl who runs away from her abusive family, only to end up in a juvenile detention center for females, where the violent acquaintances she made in her previous life beat and sexually assault her. Only one honest social worker is willing to help her out with this situation. In the film, Baldwin portrays the role of Denny, the bartender.</p><h2>Janit Baldwin: Career</h2><p>In the 1977 horror film “Ruby,” Baldwin plays Piper Laurie’s mute daughter, who is possessed by the vengeful ghost of a brutal mobster. The film was directed by Tobe Hooper. The movie was a resounding success, and the poster ensured that Janit would be remembered for all time.</p><p>The plot of the movie centers on a drive-in theater that Ruby Claire now controls and the succession of gruesome murders that occur there sixteen years after her mobster fiance was gunned down and killed by four of his cronies. A visiting psychic believes that powers from the afterlife are seeking payback and that this may be the cause of Leslie’s increasingly strange behavior. Leslie is the mother’s mute daughter.</p><p>Ms. Baldwin has appeared as a guest star on a number of television shows, including Gunsmoke (1955), The Waltons (1972), Emergency! (1972), Hawaii Five-O (1968), and Baretta (1975). Janit has experience acting in a variety of mediums, including on stage, in commercials for television, on film and television, and in television advertisements.</p><p>After delivering a standout performance as a headstrong young woman in the simply good horror film Humongous (1982), Janit decided to leave the acting industry and pursue a successful career as a fashion designer instead. She went on to have a long and successful career in the fashion industry.</p><h2>Janit Baldwin As A Producer Of A Travel Show</h2><p>Janit is the creator of “Woman on the Verge of Adventure,” a half-hour armchair travel program that focuses on the appreciation of people and culture through the mediums of art, craft, cuisine, and music. Janit also produced the program. PBS decided to join the search for national sponsors after finding that the majority of travel decisions and bookings are made by females.</p><p>During her travels, Janit was able to visit a magnificent gallery display in Mexico City. She was haunted by the artist’s story even after she finished reading the artist’s biography because she was unable to shake the idea of how her life unfolded.</p><p>The film “The Remedy, a Surreal History of Remedios Varo,” which is partially based on the life of the renowned Surrealist painter Remedios Varo, tells the narrative of how she finds her voice in the midst of a revolutionary movement in art history when art turns against her.</p><p></p><h2>Janit Baldwin: Childhood And Family</h2><p>Actress Janit Baldwin was born in Kansas City, Missouri, in the United States of America, on July 24, 1953. Therefore, she is 69 years old at this point in her life.</p><p>Her mother, the actress Dona Baldwin, was her primary caregiver throughout her childhood. Her dad is from Canada. Dona’s most well-known works include Badlands (1973), Scarface (1983), and Terminal Island.</p><p>According to the information provided on Dona’s LinkedIn page, she was able to raise three children on her own while also managing the businesses of other people. Despite this, she was unable to break through the proverbial glass ceiling. In her spare time, she worked in the entertainment industry as an actress, model, voice actress, and print artist.</p><p>Janit led a creative and nomadic existence until she was coerced into enrolling in a school for young women that was run by nuns. She would jump from one endeavor to the next.</p><p>These incredibly progressive nuns, according to Janit, showed her that she could learn anything she wanted to, motivating her to write her first musical, “Smell,” which they permitted her to present as “Lunchtime Theater.”</p><p>Janit, a little woman with auburn hair and blue eyes, had her debut in the film industry in Prime Cut, which was directed by Michael Ritchie. Janit is 17 years old (1972).</p><p>Janit moved to Los Angeles after being offered a role in her first film among renowned actors such as Lee Marvin, Gene Hackman, and Sissy Spacek. When they suddenly moved the action to Canada, she needed to be 18 years old and a citizen of that country. The setting had previously been in the United States.</p><h2>Janit Baldwin: Net Worth</h2><p>The amount that Janit Baldwin has amassed as a net worth is now being evaluated. However, due to her long career in the entertainment sector, she must have amassed a respectable amount of wealth.</p><p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) of the United States of America, the average yearly salary for writers and authors, which includes screenwriters, is $67,120. As a consequence of this, a screenwriter’s salary may fluctuate depending on a variety of factors, such as the level of experience the screenwriter possesses, the kind of screenplays the screenwriter produces, and the level of economic success the screenwriter enjoys.</p><p>A screenwriter with a lot of experience, a solid body of past work, and a solid reputation, for instance, may have better luck selling their scripts than a writer with less expertise or recognition in the field. There is no doubt in our minds that Baldwin possesses the background and expertise required to generate a sizeable income.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Who plays Joanie Brody In Gunsmoke?</h3><p>Janit Baldwin plays Joanie Brody in Gunsmoke.</p><h3>How old is Janit Baldwin?</h3><p>Janit Baldwin is 69 years old as she was born on July 24, 1953.</p><h3>Where is Janit Baldwin now?</h3><p>Janit is a well-known fashion designer of lady’s accessories and leather purses.</p><h2>Janit Baldwin: Personal Information</h2><table width=1431><tbody readability=3.5><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Janit Baldwin</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Profession</td><td>Actress, screen-writer and producer</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>July 24, 1953</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>69 years old</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Birth Place</td><td>Kansas City, Missouri, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Dona Baldwin</td></tr><tr><td>Zodaic Sign</td><td>Leo</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5′ 5″ (1.65 m)</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOo5inoaRir6K4w7Cgp2WXqru0uc6knGaZXam%2ForXLZqafZZKhvLCw0qGcnWWTlsC1ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kourtney-kardashian-calls-placenta-pills-life-changing-shares-pic.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kourtney Kardashian Calls Placenta Pills &amp;quot;Life Changing,&amp;quot; Shares Pic</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cleaning-grout-cleaner-sends-tiktok-users-wild-i-was-blown-away.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cleaning: Grout cleaner sends TikTok users wild - 'I was blown away'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-former-assistant-felicia-culotta-shares-thoughts-on-her-boyfriend-sam-asghari.html>Britney Spears' Former Assistant Felicia Culotta Shares Thoughts on Her Boyfriend Sam Asghari</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-season-pass-gets-you-an-extra-multiplayer-map-at-launch.html>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's season pass gets you an extra multiplayer map at launch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-lawrence-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-wiki.html>Charlotte Lawrence - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dakota-johnson-finally-opens-up-what-it-was-like-to-make-fifty-shades-of-grey-spoiler-alert-it-wasn.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog.
