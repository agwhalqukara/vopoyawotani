"I thought that I was done as an actress [after the sitcom]. I really thought that I was retiring and I didn't want to do it anymore. And now I'm doing it again, and I really enjoy it."</p><p>Her former co-star, the 26-year-old Bynes, is another story. Though the self-proclaimed "retired multi-millionaire" recently told <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> she's doing fine, reports of her multiple driving-related arrests are concerning to family and friends — among them, Garth.</p><p>"I haven't talked to her," the former Beverly Hills, 90210 actress told Probst. "I've tried. She's like a little sister to me, so I would love to wrap my arms around her right now. But I haven't been able to reach her."</p><p>In any case, Garth has her hands full with three girls of her own: Luca, 15, Lola, 9, and Fiona, 5, her daughters with estranged husband <a href=#><strong>Peter Facinelli</strong></a>. (Garth and the Twilight Saga star, 38, announced their separation after 11 years of marriage in January.)</p><p>And then, of course, there's her newly active love life.</p><p>"I always said when I was married that I would rather lick the bottom of my shoe than go on a date," the actress said, adding that she has had trouble finding people to take her out. ("There's a guy on my Instagram who wants me to marry him, but I don't know him," she joked.)</p><p>In fact, the blonde beauty has had no shortage of suitors since announcing her split with Facinelli. In recent months, she's been spotted out with HGTV star <strong>Antonio Ballatore</strong>, <a href=#>photographer <strong>Noah Abrams</strong></a>, and <a href=#><strong>Jason Clark</strong></a>, a managing director at Jones Lang LaSalle in Los Angeles. But there's no one special right now, she told Probst.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I have no personal life," she insisted. "The minute I think I'm ready to start dating, I realize, 'Oh no, [I'm] not.' I get in my own way…I just don't know how to date."</p><p>When she does date, though, she has some very specific requirements. Her ideal guy? A tall, funny, financially stable bad boy who's open to getting tattoos. (Hello, Dylan McKay!)</p><p>"I only like guys that are not nice," Garth told Probst. "What is wrong with us girls? It's not that I want somebody to treat me badly. I want somebody who looks like they could treat me badly but then really treats me good."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKGepp6esm6zwKuroWWZYq6tuc6sq2appZ7Bbq3CraCnn12Ws7Wx0WaYppmema5urtinnKxlo57BpLvMZmlpaWJqfnI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jon-and-kate-gosselin-s-daughter-mady-wears-tight-black-dress-celebrates-21st-birthday-as-parent.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jon and Kate Gosselins daughter Mady wears tight black dress &amp;amp; celebrates 21st birthday as parent</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-theogedp445-on-tiktok-the-big-cheese-is-taking-over-tiktok-real-name-revealed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is @Theogedp445 On TikTok?
