Everyone knows that Taylor Swift is a great lyricist and writer, and so too is John Mayer. That was one of the things they had in common when they were a couple, but it also makes them equally qualified to critique each other’s work — and that’s exactly what John Mayer did when he pointed out one of Taylor’s lyrics and actually used the words: you’re insane when he explained his issue.</p><p>In the lyrics to the song “Lover,” Taylor is describing things that a couple might do if they are “crazy” in love and not thinking about what other people’s opinions are. She speaks about leaving Christmas lights up, letting friends crash in the living room, and making the rules for their own relationship.</p><p>The lyrics resonated with many people worldwide and helped propel Taylor’s album to the AMAs (where it <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">won best pop/rock album</a>) and has been nominated for the best song Grammy. However; John Mayer pointed out something with the lyrics and other people are agreeing with him.</p><p>John Mayer recently stated the following.</p><p>“I get a little chuckle because she says, ‘We can keep the Christmas lights up till January,’ and I go, ‘You’re insane. Everyone keeps their Christmas lights up until January.”</p><p>The Internet agrees that John Mayer is not wrong. Everyone does keep their Christmas lights up until January.</p><p>You can see the official video of Taylor Swift singing “Lover” in the video player below.</p><p></p><p>Now, some people say that every time they hear the song that starts off with the line, they instantly think of John Mayer pointing out the glaring mishap.</p><p>What do you think? Should Taylor Swift have changed that lyric to something like, “We can keep the Christmas lights up until February?”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Do you agree with John Mayer? Do you think that everyone leaves their Christmas lights up until January, therefore, the analogy of “breaking the rules” and “doing what you want despite what others say” is kind of lost in the first line of the song?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeapLWvecyasJ6qo2KzprHDm5ico12ku27AwLKjqKpdqMSqstOsZKGhpGLAsLrGZqOorpWneqmt0makmqapYq6ovsSeoKefXay2tbSMoaCmZWNpg3eAj2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./keke-palmer-bio-age-height-net-worth-husband-marriage.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Keke Palmer- Bio, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Marriage</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./intense-craving.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Intense craving</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-former-assistant-felicia-culotta-shares-thoughts-on-her-boyfriend-sam-asghari.html>Britney Spears' Former Assistant Felicia Culotta Shares Thoughts on Her Boyfriend Sam Asghari</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-season-pass-gets-you-an-extra-multiplayer-map-at-launch.html>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's season pass gets you an extra multiplayer map at launch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-lawrence-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-wiki.html>Charlotte Lawrence - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dakota-johnson-finally-opens-up-what-it-was-like-to-make-fifty-shades-of-grey-spoiler-alert-it-wasn.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog.
