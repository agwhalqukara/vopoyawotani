It was released in 2007, and every new installment made it better and better. The game’s story is loved by every gamer and even those who watch these gamers’ streams! A movie adapted from a game is nothing new in Hollywood. Many movies are based on some popular games, for example,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Resident Evil, Assassin’s Creed,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>and</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;Prince of Persia.&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>We agree that these movies were not better than the video games, and some were not able to convince the audience, but we are hoping that the upcoming film will put on a better show; after all, some big names are involved with the movie.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tom Holland is in the lead role as Nathan, and Mark Wahlberg is playing Victor “Sully” Sullivan. Sully is an American treasure hunter in the game as well as a mentor, friend, and father figure to Nathan Drake. For the fans of the game, it is a belief that Sully has been rocking a mustache his whole life; maybe he was born with a mustache. However, Mark Wahlberg and Tom Holland’s pictures were taken on the set in Berlin. Both of them were in suits, and everything was fine, but just one thing, and the most important thing for gamers, Wahlberg, didn’t have any mustache! Everyone was shocked and shook the internet with tweets saying no mustache means no Sully.&nbsp;</span></p><p lang=de dir=ltr>? | <a href=#>@TomHolland1996</a> and Mark Wahlberg shooting <a href=#>#Uncharted</a> in Berlin last night <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZfjMQwawf1</a></p>— Tom Holland News (@THollandNews) <a href=#>September 15, 2020</a><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Everyone thought Wahlberg would wear a false mustache for filming because there is no way fans are going to accept a Sully without a mustache. But that is not the complete picture, recently Wahlberg took to Instagram and gave the fans a first look of Sully, and you can see him Rocking that mustache. Moustache is the trademark of Sully’s look, and now Mark Wahlberg has grown a glorious mustache that fans are loving. Tom Holland also stated that Mark looks fantastic and he is gonna be as amazing as Sully; Mark, on the other hand, didn’t look pleased with a mustache as he said in the video- “don’t ask… Don’t F***ing ask!”</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Tom Holland also revealed his look in the upcoming movie, and you can see him dressing up like Nate from Uncharted, an off-white Henley shirt, Sir Francis Drake’s ring around his neck, and twin-gun holsters. Tom appears to be posing like the cover of Uncharted 3.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When Tom Holland was asked about the movie’s plot, Tom informed us that it would be a fresh take. He added that the story would not miss the game’s epic events, but it will undoubtedly be entertaining for the gamers and the fans who are unaware of the game’s plot.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nolan North, the original Nathan Drake voice actor, also shared some images from the set, proving that&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Uncharted’s</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true> filming is still going on. In addition to Mark and Holland, Sophia Taylor Ali, Antonio Banderas, and Tati Gabrielle are set to star in the movie. After being hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, the movie is now set to hit the big screens on 16th July 2021.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Like looking into a mirror!
