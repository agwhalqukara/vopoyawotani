That left Detroit with a decision, which wasn't necessarily as easy as it seemed on the surface.</p><p>On the one hand, Cunningham is a franchise player and the No. 1 overall pick of the 2021 NBA draft who has shown far more than just flashes of excellence during the early portion of his career.</p><p>He has looked like a building block for years to come, which is underscored by the decision to sign him to an extension.</p><p>On the other hand, Cunningham's presence hasn't exactly led to many wins. The Pistons went 23-59 in his rookie season, 17-65 in his second season and 14-68 in his third.</p><p>Detroit could have waited before finalizing a new deal down the line since he was still previously under contract until the summer of 2025. Even then, he would have been a restricted free agent, meaning the team could have matched any offers and kept him on the roster.</p><p>The Pistons' front office still had plenty of team control and didn't necessarily need to rush into a decision.</p><p>Still, this gives a franchise that has struggled for years something to rally around moving forward.</p><p>Cunningham has shown steady improvement through his three seasons in the league, and the 2023-24 one was his best individual effort. He averaged 22.7 points, 7.5 assists and 4.3 rebounds per game while shooting 44.9 percent from the field and 35.5 percent from deep.</p><p>The points, assists, field-goal percentage and three-point percentage were all career-best numbers.</p><p>There might finally be some reason for optimism in Detroit, as Cunningham is just 22 years old. What's more, Jaden Ivey—the No. 5 overall pick of the 2022 draft—is also 22, while Jalen Duren—the No. 13 overall pick of the 2022 draft—is just 20.</p><p>Cunningham is now with the Pistons for the long run and will look to reestablish the only NBA team he has ever known as a winner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWp%2Bc4WMp5maZaKqurC%2B0manoqukpLu0ecKam55lk6q7r7XNoJ%2BapV2osrV506hkrKGXo3p2ediemKtlYmeDrnnMmq9mqp%2BkuKqxjJymp6yilrC1</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./paul-o-grady-quits-bbc-radio-2-show.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Paul O'Grady QUITS BBC Radio 2 show</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jenny-craig-s-weight-loss-centers-may-disappear-for-good.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jenny Craig's Weight-Loss Centers May Disappear for Good</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-former-assistant-felicia-culotta-shares-thoughts-on-her-boyfriend-sam-asghari.html>Britney Spears' Former Assistant Felicia Culotta Shares Thoughts on Her Boyfriend Sam Asghari</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-season-pass-gets-you-an-extra-multiplayer-map-at-launch.html>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's season pass gets you an extra multiplayer map at launch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-lawrence-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-wiki.html>Charlotte Lawrence - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dakota-johnson-finally-opens-up-what-it-was-like-to-make-fifty-shades-of-grey-spoiler-alert-it-wasn.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog.
