"They've given him, presumably, the largest coaching contract offer in the history of the franchise. They've brought him out to give him their vision, and he's been home for several days with no [decision]. ... They've so prioritized Dan Hurley that they've let other potential candidates go off the board elsewhere. It took them a while to get Dan Hurley interested enough to seriously engage with them, they've got that engagement, and now they've gotta hope they were able to close it."</p><p>Windhorst noted that James Borrego, who has met with Lakers officials twice regarding the vacancy, has momentum to land the Cleveland Cavaliers' vacancy. Borrego and former NBA guard JJ Redick were seen as the two favorites for the Lakers' job publicly before Hurley's name soared to the top of the list last week.</p><p>Hurley told ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Adrian Wojnarowski</a> he's torn between the Lakers' offer and staying at UConn, where he has won back-to-back national championships. The 51-year-old said he was "extremely impressed" with Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka and owner Jeanie Buss, who offered him a "compelling vision" for the future.</p><p>According to Hurley, Pelinka and Buss pitched him not only on being able to compete for NBA championships immediately with LeBron James and Anthony Davis but also offered a long-term vision for the franchise.</p><p>Hurley has no NBA head coaching experience. He spent a decade as a head coach at St. Benedict's Prep in New Jersey before working with Wagner and Rhode Island at the collegiate level.</p><p>Redick has never coached beyond the youth level and has spent his post-playing career in the media with ESPN. He was considered a strong favorite among most observers for much of the process, but Hurley has seemingly been the Lakers' top choice all along.</p><p>Borrego is the only one of the three top candidates with any NBA head coaching experience, but he seems like a clear third choice.</p><p>Regardless, the Lakers aren't going to have to wait much longer to know if they're headed back to the drawing board.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYml%2Fc3%2BMp5maZaKqurC%2B0majmqOVp8Buu81mnJ2flWKuo7vUrWSdmZ5itba%2By56wZpyVmLa0tc6nZJqlmZl6sbvSrKCbpJViv6bA1KulZqyfYsKku82n</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./study-wearables-can-empower-patients-but-barriers-prevent-greater-adoption.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Study: Wearables can empower patients, but barriers prevent greater adoption</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./vanderpump-rules-fans-slam-katie-maloney-as-a-hypocrite-after-she-gets-james-kennedy-fired.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Vanderpump Rules Fans Slam Katie Maloney As A Hypocrite After She Gets James Kennedy Fired</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-former-assistant-felicia-culotta-shares-thoughts-on-her-boyfriend-sam-asghari.html>Britney Spears' Former Assistant Felicia Culotta Shares Thoughts on Her Boyfriend Sam Asghari</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-season-pass-gets-you-an-extra-multiplayer-map-at-launch.html>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's season pass gets you an extra multiplayer map at launch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-lawrence-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-wiki.html>Charlotte Lawrence - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dakota-johnson-finally-opens-up-what-it-was-like-to-make-fifty-shades-of-grey-spoiler-alert-it-wasn.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog.
