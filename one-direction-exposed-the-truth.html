As I’m sure you’re aware, there’s&nbsp;<span>another&nbsp;</span>article going round telling the world how ‘rivalry, hatred and drugs tore 1D apart’ – written by&nbsp;my&nbsp;<span>favourite&nbsp;</span>tabloid.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>If you haven’t gotten round to reading it yet, you can give that line a Google and I’m sure it’ll pop up. However, if I were you, I wouldn’t waste my time reading such nonsense. The article claims to know every little secret ever kept by the band, all revealed by their ‘sources’. I’m not a professional investigator, but I’m sure these sources are as reliable as Volkswagen’s emission test results.</span></p><p><span>In my opinion, if there’s no name, how do you know there’s actually a source? Journalists will do anything to get people to read their articles – even if it means there was no journalism actually done and they make up everything they’ve typed. Laziness.</span></p><p><span>The first part which really caught my attention was when the writer, Dan Wootton, claimed that the boys of One Direction – Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne, Niall Horan and former member Zayn Malik – were ‘forced to work together’ since The X Factor days.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span>Forced.</span></strong></p><p><span>Let me get this across loud and clear – in the beginning, no one&nbsp;<span>forced&nbsp;</span>those boys into anything. They were, as Simon put it, offered ‘a lifeline’ but not one single person made them agree. That was their decision. Plus, it’s not like they couldn’t pull out mid-series; we’ve seen it been done before by the likes of Lucy Spraggan and, most recently, Joe Waller.</span></p><p><span>The article then goes on to explain how a ‘falling-out’ between band mates Harry and Louis in 2012 has caused such hatred between them that Harry wouldn’t even fly on the same jet as Louis.</span></p><p><span>The awful thing about all of this is that if you’re not a fan of One Direction, you’ll believe anything you’re told about them. That’s the cold, hard truth which has been shown time and time again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, if you’re a fan and heavily involved within the fandom, you’ll know just how ridiculous that statement is. Harry is one of the kindest men around, and – even if they had a massive argument – he wouldn’t be so uptight to make such a fuss about it and say he’s not flying on the same jet. I mean, it’s not like they’d be forced to sit next to each other, is it?</span></p><p><span>In fact, I do remember the pair arriving at LAX together to hop on a flight to Australia earlier on this year. So much hatred there, right?! The notion is utterly insane, if you ask me.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Wootton then delves into ‘Larry Stylinson’ (the idea that Harry and Louis are in a private relationship, if you didn’t already know) making a massive fuss about it and then calling it ‘laughable’. He even goes on to say that ‘neither is gay.’ Something which should be left for them to say, rather than a journalist doing it for them – don’t you think?</span></p><p><span>Personally, I believe that everyone is allowed their opinions, so when you have journalists coming in and slamming down what someone believes, I find it incredibly rude and frustrating. So what if people believe they’re in a relationship? If that idea makes them happy, allow them to have it. Each to their own and all that.</span></p><p><span>Don’t get me wrong, you do get the people who take things to the extreme but from my personal experience, that group of people is a minority. So, when you’ve got the people happily shipping two people together – whilst it not directly affecting<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>their&nbsp;lives – leave them be. You wouldn’t want someone to call out your beliefs and tell you that you’re wrong, so don’t do it to others.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I think it’s incredible that all these ‘facts’ have only just come now. According to the article, a lot of the problems came about years ago – so why bring them up now? Just when they’re about to finish their last tour before their hiatus. Wanted to selfishly grab the last bit of money out of the band before you’re stuck with nothing to write about?</span></p><p><span>One thing I do find odd, is that the article seems to do as much as it can to praise Harry and ruin Louis’ public image. It was all about solo Harry going far and never coming back and that Louis is ‘ambitious’ (not likely to make it because ‘he’s not the most talented member’).&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Hmm, seems to be rather biased to me.</span></p><p><span>While this article aims to point out all the flaws in the band – from hatred, to drug scandals, slyness and addictions – and blame it on each of the members individually (as well as indirectly pointing a finger at the fans), I want to add another side to the story.</span></p><p><span>Over the past few years, I’ve seen the band been worked to the absolute max. It’s been non-stop touring, recording and releasing albums, bringing out new merchandise and all the other unnecessary things that have given the boys little time off.</span></p><p><span>And, surely, when you’re overworked&nbsp;things are going to go wrong. So why not take a step back and see where the source of the problem lies, because I hardly doubt you can blame those boys for only ever trying to do their best.</span></p><p><span>Follow the bumpy road along One Direction’s journey to the beginning of the problems and you’ll find management. The people who have only ever tried to increase the boys’ workload, especially during the Where We Are tour.</span></p><p><span>That’s when everything got too much. You could see it when they were doing constant TV appearances – they were&nbsp;<span>tired</span><span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>and I don’t blame them.</span></p><p><span>My only hope is for that not to happen to them again before this well-deserved break but it seems as though there can’t be any promises made. Tons of events to occur before the band can officially relax have already been announced and I dread to see how many more are to come.</span></p><p><span>I’d also like to add that since Zayn left the group in March, they’ve only gotten closer. The departure of a member has actually brought them together – rather than created arguments that the media believes are the real reason for the band’s time off. No, I don’t think so.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It’s about time ‘journalists’ stopped trying to expose the members of a band, and started doing their research.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For now, I look forward to seeing Harry, Louis, Liam and Niall back together and well rested when they decide the time is right.</span></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>don't believe anything you are reading.
