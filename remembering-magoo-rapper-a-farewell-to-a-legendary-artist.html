R&B musician Digital Black, real name Benjamin Bush, recently announced the terrible news of his passing on the social networking site Instagram.</p><p>He captioned an old photo of himself and Magoo, “Man can’t believe this RIH Magoo damn big bro wasn’t ready for this all #superfriends.” The precise reason for Magoo’s passing is unknown as of right now.</p>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Digital Black (@blackplaya502)</a></p><h3>Who was Magoo?</h3><p>Let us share with those of you who are unaware that Magoo was born Melvin Barcliff in Norfolk, Virginia. He started playing around with music when he was a teenager. His work with Timbaland on songs like Jumps da Boogie, Welcome to Our World, and Deep In Your Memory, among many others, is what most people remember him for.</p><p>Additionally, Melvin collaborated with a number of well-known musicians, such as Missy Elliot on Beep 911 and Playa for Derma City (Interlude). In a previous interview with You Know I Got Soul, he disclosed that he and Timbaland, then known as Tim Mosley, first connected as kids in Norfolk through Larry Live.

He revealed his difficult early years at that time, saying, “We didn’t care about the celebrity. Since Michael Jackson was broadcasting at the time, the dream involved hearing yourself on the radio.</p><h3>When was the band ‘Timbaland & Magoo’ formed?</h3><p>Timbaland & Magoo was founded by Tim and Melvin in 1995. They had a contract with Blackground Records back then. In 1997, the team released their first studio album, Welcome to Our World, which went on to sell over 1.6 million copies.</p><p>In 2001, Indecent Proposal, their second album, was released. Under Construction Part II, on the other hand, which is their third album, was published in 2003. Their third record was meant to be the follow-up to Missy Elliot’s Under Construction.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/889AF329-D625-4E6D-9FD7-92182721D4DE-1.jpg alt="magoo rapper net worth,what happened to magoo,magoo rapper instagram,magoo died cause of death,how did magoo passed away,melvin magoo barcliff cause of death,magoo wife,magoo cause of death reddit,magoo rapper now,magoo rapper death *graphic*,magoo rapper death *2017,magoo rapper indian,magoo rapper wiki" width=250 height=250 sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>We extend our heartfelt sympathies to the famous artist Magoo’s close friends and family at this trying time.
