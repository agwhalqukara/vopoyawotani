He is, however, most recognized as the ex-husband of well-known British producer and actress Gemma Arterton.</strong></p><p>The actress is also best recognized for her roles in movies such as Quantum of Solace&nbsp;and Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, Hansel & Gretel, and Clash of Titans, amongst others. Even with the fact that he and the actress are no longer married, his interest in the life of Gemma has not diminished one bit. So here is the untold truth about the Italian fashion icon.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Stefano Catelli’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Stefano Catelli</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> 1985</li><li><strong>Stefano Catelli’s Age:</strong> 38 years old</li><li><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> Italy</li><li><strong>Stefano Catelli’s Ethnicity:</strong> Caucasian</li><li><strong>Stefano Catelli’s Nationality:</strong> Italian</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Stefano Catelli’s Religion:</strong> Christian</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Divorced</li><li><strong>Stefano Catelli’s Ex-Wife:</strong> Gemma Arterton</li><li><strong>Stefano Catelli’s Height in Inches:</strong> 6 feet</li><li><strong>Stefano Catelli’s Height in Centimeters:</strong> 183 cm</li><li><strong>Stefano Catelli’s Weight:</strong> 76kg (168lbs)</li><li><strong>Hair Color:</strong> Dark Brown</li><li><strong>Eye Color:</strong> Dark Brown</li><li><strong>Profession:</strong> Businessman and Fashion Designer</li><li><strong>Stefano Catelli’s Net Worth:</strong> Est. $200k</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being a fashion designer and also the ex-husband of British-born actress, Gemma Arterton</li></ul><h2><strong>How Old Is Stefano Catelli, and Where Was She Born?</strong></h2><p>Stefano Catelli is 38 years old, and was born in 1985. His birth country is Italy, and he is an Italian citizen by birth. Sources close to the fashion designer have claimed that he was very shy as a child, and it seems as if Stefano has carried some of that shyness into adulthood because he rarely talks about his early years on earth and childhood.</p><p>To further illustrate how much of a private person Stefano is, there is next to no information about his parents, such as who they are/were, where they live/lived and what they do/did for a living. Similarly, there is also no way to know if Stefano was an only child or if he had siblings with whom he shared a household.</p><p>There is yet more dearth of information where it concerns Stefano Catelli’s formal education background. No publicly available records exactly tell us where Stefano attended high school. Certain sources claim that he developed a taste and passion for good fashion while he was in high school and that passion led to him bagging a fashion degree at a reputable but unnamed fashion institute.</p><h2><strong>Stefano Catelli Currently Works With Four Marketing</strong></h2><p>Stefano Catelli has always loved the fashion business, and after grabbing his fashion degree, he decided it was time to put all he had learned to good use. His first port of call as an employee came in the stores of Club 21, where he rose through the ranks to become the menswear manager at the outfit.</p><p>Catelli also used to work with Weston Representatives as a sales manager. Over the years, the Italian-born fashion designer has put his skill and training to good use by working with many reputable brands where his input was highly regarded and valuable as well.</p><p>Stefano Catelli has made no secret of his big dreams to own his fashion outfit and brand that will better display his ideas and idiosyncrasies on fashion. At the moment, though, he is making do with being a product manager at Four Marketing.</p><p>So far, his dedication and hard work have helped him to acquire a net worth which is estimated to be around $200k. That figure pales in comparison to that of his star actress ex-wife, who is reportedly worth an estimated $13 million.</p><h2><strong>Stefano Catelli Was Married To Gemma Arterton For About 2 Years</strong></h2><p>Stefano Catelli reportedly met his ex-wife, Gemma Arterton, in 2009. The exact place or how is currently unknown, but they dated for around a year before tying the knot in an intimate ceremony in Zaheros, Spain, on June 5, 2010.</p><p>For anyone who is wondering, Catelli’s ex-wife, Gemma Arterton, is a well-known British producer and actress who burst onto the acting scene with a rousing performance in Quantum of Solace, a performance that secured her an Empire Award for Best Newcomer.</p><p>She has also appeared in many movies, including Clash of Titans, Prince of Persia: Sands of Time, Hansel & Gretel, and most recently as Grace Ballard in Netflix’s Murder Mystery.</p><h3><strong>Stefano Catelli And Gemma Arterton Divorced In 2015</strong></h3><p>At the beginning of the marriage between Stefano Catelli and Gemma Arterton, everything seemed rosy, and all was right with the world. Just around two years after their wedding, the public woke up to the shocking news that the fashion designer and his then-star actress wife had filed for a divorce.</p><p>It was an unexpected development that occurred in 2012, and after another three years, the divorce was finalized in 2015. The separation and eventual divorce did not strain relations between Stefano and Gemma, and the ex-couple have remained friends since then.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/06/Stefano-Catelli1-1.jpg alt="Stefano Catelli" width=696 height=459 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>It is thought that the primary reason between the separation and eventual divorce of Stefano and Gemma was their inability to agree on the issue of having kids together.</p><p>Stefano Catelli did not want to have children, which was a choice that did not sit well with Gemma, who, although she wanted them much later in life, after fulfilling much of her career dreams, wanted them regardless.&nbsp;It goes without saying then that Stefano Catelli and Gemma Arterton did not have children together throughout a nearly 3-year marriage.</p><h2><strong>Stefano Catelli Is Currently Residing In London</strong></h2><p>As earlier mentioned, Stefano Catelli currently works with Four Marketing and resides in London, where their offices are located. It would also appear that the fashion designer has been steadfast in his decision not to procreate and is probably yet to find the right woman who would agree with his choice not to have children.</p><p>Stefano Catelli also seems like he is not a fan of social media as he has recorded no presence on any of the well-known social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and Facebook.</p><p>On the other hand, his ex-wife, Gemma, remarried four years after their divorce. She wed fellow actor Rory Keenan in 2019. She is also quite active on the social media platform known as Instagram. On the platform, the talented British actress operates under the handle @gemma_arterton_ and has a strong following of over 8,200 followers.</p><h2><strong>Key Takeaways About Stefano Catelli</strong></h2><li><strong>Who is Stefano Catelli?</strong> Stefano Catelli is an Italian fashion designer and businessman.
