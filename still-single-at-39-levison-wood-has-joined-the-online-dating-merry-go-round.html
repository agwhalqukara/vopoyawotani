So what was his strategy then?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘You have to humanise yourself. Find some empathy, find a connection, find some common ground.

Or am I overthinking this?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Perhaps Levison, 39, is just a nice guy with good manners and a gift for accidental innuendoes that must have had the squaddies in fits, way back when.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Today he is wearing what he calls his ‘double-denim’ shirt and trousers, with a Belstaff bike jacket and motorbike boots. ‘I like to keep my rides to within two hours, otherwise it starts to get a bit dull and wet,’ he says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Indeed.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He also likes to paramotor, a hobby that is a form of powered paragliding in which ‘I basically strap a lawn mower engine to my back — very James Bond’.

You’re thinking: ‘What hardship can this former Parachute Regiment captain-turned-adventurer, explorer and sex symbol (‘Thank you! I’ll take that. Nobody has called me a sex symbol since 2016.’) possibly have suffered during the pandemic?’ And the answer is, quite a lot, actually.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>For a start, he had to move home because of a stalker who threatened his family, ignored police restraining orders and ended up in jail. ‘Although she is out now,’ he notes. ‘I hope it doesn’t flare up again but you never know, do you?’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She once slept on a bench in Battersea Park, hoping to catch him on his early morning run. She would turn up at his home, which forced him to put it on the market.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It is very sad for the individual concerned. You feel a level of empathy, you want them to get help, but it’s difficult when it crosses the line. Especially when she was sending messages to my family and girlfriends.</p><p><span class=femail-ccox>I’ve used dating apps. How else are you meant to meet someone in lockdown?! I don’t have a type at all. If a woman is intelligent, interesting and fun, that’s the basis really&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It gets weird. Uncomfortable. Someone who believes you caught their eye at a public event and that you have a connection.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Then he bought a lockdown puppy to keep him company; a Ridgeback called Byron. Sadly, it caught a parasite called lungworm and died in December.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I cried my eyes out,’ says the former Captain Wood, who served in Afghanistan for four years and was embedded with Iraqi troops fighting Isis while on a documentary expedition to the Arabian Peninsula in 2017.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I don’t have children and I’m not suggesting it is necessarily the same, but this dog came into my life and, actually, for me, he was my child. It was really sad. He taught me a lot about companionship and love, and he was a great little dog.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During that same month, he broke his ankle when paramotoring. ‘To be honest,’ he sighs, ‘it was a pretty s*** Christmas.’ In addition, his income dried up when all his expeditions and TV shows were cancelled because of the pandemic.</p><img decoding=async id=i-3c88281b3540e4a7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/06/20/43899319-9657797-image-a-25_1623008783485.jpg height=812 width=634 alt="Levison (pictured) said he has been living off his savings because he hasn't been paid in 12 months and lost a lot of money" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><img decoding=async id=i-3c88281b3540e4a7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/06/20/43899319-9657797-image-a-25_1623008783485.jpg height=812 width=634 alt="Levison (pictured) said he has been living off his savings because he hasn't been paid in 12 months and lost a lot of money" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=imageCaption>Levison (pictured) said he has been living off his savings because he hasn’t been paid in 12 months and lost a lot of money&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I know that people have had it worse than me, but I have lost a lot of money. I haven’t been paid in 12 months and have been living off my savings. It has been tough. Hopefully I can soon get out there and start making some TV again.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But he didn’t sit around doing nothing. Last year, Levison volunteered for Re:Act, a disaster-response charity which uses military veterans and responders with blue-light experience to help with difficult jobs in times of national duress.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>During the worst days of the pandemic, he worked at a temporary mortuary near Heathrow Airport. ‘It was quite shocking, dealing with the numbers that were coming in. Quite full-on,’ he says.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In his private life, he has never been one to ‘court the limelight’ or go to ‘fancy parties’, so much of his lockdown has been spent alone at his home in South-West London.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>With no money coming in, he has been living a frugal life; eating homemade stir-fries and steamed vegetables, doing the occasional vegan detox. He doesn’t watch TV, only enjoys films on planes and rarely reads novels, although he has just finished ‘a gloomy Portuguese one about a plague’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There has also been ‘intermittent fasting, lots of yoga, lots of meditation and learning the art of patience.’</p><img decoding=async id=i-c43f6f74cbb41e58 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/06/20/43899313-9657797-image-a-16_1623008668357.jpg height=845 width=634 alt="Levison (pictured) said he used dating websites to meet girls, when lockdown rules permitted but a lot thought he was a catfish" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><img decoding=async id=i-c43f6f74cbb41e58 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/06/06/20/43899313-9657797-image-a-16_1623008668357.jpg height=845 width=634 alt="Levison (pictured) said he used dating websites to meet girls, when lockdown rules permitted but a lot thought he was a catfish" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=imageCaption>Levison (pictured) said he used dating websites to meet girls, when lockdown rules permitted but a lot thought he was a catfish&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That all sounds very monk-like.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Not entirely monkish,’ he says, rather roguishly.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>When lockdown rules permitted, he used dating websites to meet girls because, as he says with a shrug, what else can a man do?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I used dating apps; I don’t see a problem with it. I use them when I want to use them. That is how people meet these days, isn’t it? How else can you meet women in lockdown?’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It also provided him with a nice opportunity to meet dates who were ‘outside my regular circle, a bit different to myself, from a different background’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Because you know what? He doesn’t have a type.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I don’t like to put people into boxes. No, I wouldn’t say I have a type at all. If a woman is intelligent, interesting, fun. That is the basis, really. I don’t really care what job they do or anything like that. It is all about being comfortable in somebody’s company and enjoying spending time with them.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One can only imagine how these women must have felt when the dashing Levison roared round in his vintage Porsche or dropped in on his paramotor like the Milk Tray man, with the sands of Araby on his motorbike boots and still hurting a little inside because his puppy had just died.

Catfishing is a term for pretending to be someone else online, using fake photos or identities to find romantic partners. The joke is that there are plenty of fake Levison Woods searching for love across the internet, yet here is the real one, doing the same thing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I don’t play up to that.

I am currently single, I live on my own and I would like to meet the right person”. ’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the past ten years, his expeditions and adventures have included walking the length of the Nile, through the Himalayas, across the Darien Gap in the Americas and crossing Madagascar on foot.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He has lived on maggot stews and bush rat, and nearly died when his Jeep went over a cliff in Nepal.
