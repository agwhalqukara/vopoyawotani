He was doing drugs, so then I started doing drugs.”</p><p>But Velásquez turned things around, and credits her hardscrabble youth growing up in a fifth-floor walkup in Venezuela without running water and her growing realization she was a role model with keeping her humble.</p><p>“The Mummy” star remembers being recognized by a young girl on 42nd Street who told her that she saw herself in the model, adding, “you taught me that it’s ok, that I am beautiful.’”</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Jason Bateman pined over Velásquez in “Arrested Development.”<span class=credit>©20thCentFox/Courtesy Everett C</span></figure><p>“And that’s when it hit me,” Velásquez says. “Not only am I trying to help my family but this is much bigger [than that]. So I think that realization just kept me going in a good direction.”</p><p>In 2015 Velásquez released a memoir, “<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Straight Walk</a>,” in which she came out, explaining that she wanted to set an example of honesty for her now-teenage daughter Maya, whom she shares with her ex-girlfriend Lauren. Velásquez and Lauren separated after eight years, and the actress and model is now happily living with producer Jennifer Kriz, often seen in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">goofy videos</a> on Velásquez’s Instagram.</p><p>“I love her,” the “Arrested Development,” star says simply. “She’s my soulmate. I’m telling you something I’ve never said to anybody. I never believed in relationships [before]. Never.”</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large">Velásquez is happy with girlfriend Jennifer.<span class=credit>Instagram</span></figure><p>Velásquez’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">first female love was actress and comic Sandra Bernhard</a>, who she says “taught me so much … she helped me.” When their relationship fizzled, the South American beauty admits that she was heartbroken for two years, though that did provide her with an idea for another book, about lesbian relationships and breakups.</p><p>“There is very, very little literature about this and their process is different [from straight couples],” she explains.</p><p>Velásquez has maintained a deep connection to her roots throughout her travels. Her mother is a member of the indigenous Wayuu people of South America, which led to the Vogue cover girl establishing a charity called <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wayuu Taya Foundation</a> in 2002, with the first check coming in from Ford Models CEO Katie Ford (and help from Iman with their first event).</p><p>The goal of the Foundation, Velásquez says, is to offer jobs and relief to Venezuelans while respecting their traditions and lifestyles.</p><p>“Over seven million people will have left the country by the end of the year,” she says, “and we’re 30 million-people country. So everything we do is to not only try and keep our communities together, but give them the means to earn a decent, earnest living that will let them stay — that will be the dream.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxno6q9pr7MqJuepF2lrrW%2ByJygmmWmmrmiv9CunLNlo5bGtHnSoZxmp56hxm60wJ1kqKaVYrCzrdmyZLKdkad6qrqMoZyrZZOWv6ax0Wg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-alluring-nancy-carell-age-height-career-highlights-and-personal-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Alluring Nancy Carell: Age, Height, Career Highlights and Personal Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./p-valley-season-2-will-release-in-june-of-2022.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>P-Valley Season 2 Will Release In June Of 2022</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-former-assistant-felicia-culotta-shares-thoughts-on-her-boyfriend-sam-asghari.html>Britney Spears' Former Assistant Felicia Culotta Shares Thoughts on Her Boyfriend Sam Asghari</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-season-pass-gets-you-an-extra-multiplayer-map-at-launch.html>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's season pass gets you an extra multiplayer map at launch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-lawrence-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-wiki.html>Charlotte Lawrence - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dakota-johnson-finally-opens-up-what-it-was-like-to-make-fifty-shades-of-grey-spoiler-alert-it-wasn.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog.
