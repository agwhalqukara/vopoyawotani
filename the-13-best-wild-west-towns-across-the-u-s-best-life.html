Many people love revisiting this time through Western movies, but if you want to <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=# data-follow=true>actually step back in time</a> to the Wild West, there are plenty of places across the U.S. to do so. For example, did you know you can visit <strong>Buffalo Bill's</strong> former lodge? Or step foot inside the O.K. Corral? If this type of living history is up your alley, read on to hear from travel experts about the 10 best small towns in the U.S. that feel like the Wild West. Cowboy boots and horses not required.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>The 10 Quirkiest Small Towns in the U.S.</a></strong></p><h2>The 13 Best Wild West Towns in the U.S.</h2><h3>1. Cody, Wyoming</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/cody-wyoming.jpg><p>Picture the Wild West in your head, and you'll likely conjure up an image pretty similar to the real-life town of Cody, Wyoming. It was established in 1896 and is named for famed buffalo hunter <strong>William Frederick "Buffalo Bill" Cody</strong>, according to <strong>Tom Mesereau</strong>, founder of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Mesereau Travel Public Relations</a>. "Inspired by the undeveloped region's combination of scenery, wildlife, and rich soil, as well as its location 52 miles from Yellowstone National Park, Buffalo Bill Cody decided to build a town," he explains. In fact, it's Buffalo Bill who coined the term "Wild West" when, in 1883, he began his traveling show Buffalo Bill's Wild West.</p><p>Today, the main attraction in Cody is the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Buffalo Bill Center of the West</a>. It's comprised of five separate museums—the Buffalo Bill Museum, where you can see actual possessions of his and <strong>Annie Oakley's</strong>, the Plains Indian Museum, the Cody Firearms Museum, the Draper Natural History Museum, and the Whitney Western Art Museum.</p><p>Mesereau also recommends checking out the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Irma Hotel</a>, which was built by Buffalo Bill himself in 1902 and named after his youngest daughter; the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Pahaska Tepee Resort</a>, a rustic lodge where Buffalo Bill brought guests including <strong>Theodore Roosevelt</strong> and the <strong>Prince of Monaco</strong>;&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Old Trail Town</a>, a collection of 19th-century frontier buildings including "one used by Butch Cassidy and his infamous Hole-in-the-Wall Gang"; and the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Cody Nite Rodeo</a>, "the longest-running summer-season nightly rodeo in the U.S."</p><h3>2. Bodie, California</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/bodie-california-ghost-town.jpg><p>Many old Western cities have been turned into tourist towns, but if you want to truly step back in time to the Wild West, head to this ghost town near the Nevada border. "Bodie, California used to be a thriving gold-rush town that had over 60 saloons at one point, producing over $35 million worth of gold and silver. It became a ghost town in 1915 when mining profits plummeted and many of the public facilities there closed down for good," explains <strong>Bradley Williams</strong>, travel writer and co-founder of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Dream Big, Travel Far</a>.</p><p>Today, the town is frozen in time and preserved as Bodie State Historic Park. "Only a small part of the town survives, preserved in a state of 'arrested decay.' Interiors remain as they were left and stocked with goods," according to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>California Department of Parks and Recreation</a>. The nonprofit <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Bodie Foundation</a> offers tours, ghost walks, and other special events.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT: <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>10 Small Towns in the U.S. That Feel Like You're in a Hallmark Movie</a>.</strong></p><h3>3. Pioneertown, California</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/pioneertown-california.jpg><p>Sandwiched between the San Bernadino National Forest and Joshua Tree National Park sits Pioneertown. Though you wouldn't tell by looking at it, this town is actually not from the Wild West days. "It was established in 1946 by a group of investors in the Hollywood business," explains <strong>Kristin Lee</strong>, travel expert and author of the blog <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://globaltravelescapades.com/&source=gmail&ust=1663294727695000&usg=AOvVaw2mx6MP_IbZgwOK6w4UDMuJ" data-follow=true>Global Travel Escapades</a>. "They wanted to create a functional movie set that looked like the Wild West in the 1880s and would simultaneously allow for a few people to live out there."</p><p>This group of investors included <strong>Dick Curtis</strong>, <strong>Roy Rogers</strong>, <strong>Gene Autry</strong>, and <strong>Bud Abbott</strong>. According to <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Visit California</a>, "more than 50 films and television shows were filmed here in the 1940s and '50s."</p><p>"Today, a few hundred people live in Pioneertown, and it's widely visited as a tourist attraction," notes Lee. She says not to miss local bar <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Pappy and Harriet's</a> and Mane Street, where "you'll find lots of wooden storefronts and tiny shops that are run by locals who are selling handcrafted goods."</p><p>For a place to stay, Visit California recommends the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Pioneertown Motel</a>, "a rustic, single-story 20-room inn [that] has been updated with fire pits, an outdoor bar, and hammocks."</p><h3>4. Tombstone, Arizona</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/tombstone-arizona-ok-corral.jpg><p>Of all the locations on this list, Tombstone, Arizona received the most love from travel experts. As <strong>Jenny Ly</strong>, travel blogger and entrepreneur at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Go Wanderly</a>, notes, "Tombstone was made immortal in under 30 seconds." That's how long the infamous gunfight at the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>O.K. Corral</a> lasted in 1881 when the Earp brothers and <strong>Doc Holliday</strong> faced off against the Clanton-McLaury outlaw gang. "Today, you can see daily reenactments of the famed firefight at the precise location where it happened," says Ly.</p><p>You can also get the feel of the Old West by walking around the downtown area. "The wooden clapboard buildings are authentic as are the wooden boardwalks," says <strong>Jocelyn Xamis Wolters</strong>, a preservationist and co-founder of the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>travel site</a>&nbsp;Wolters World. While here, be sure to spot "the 140 bullet holes in the walls of the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Bird Cage Theater</a>, a famed 1880s nightclub, attesting to the town's violent past," says Ly.</p><p>Other attractions include the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Old Tombstone Western Theme Park</a>, where you can see another gunfight show; the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Boot Hill Graveyard</a>, a National Register site that offers tours; the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Tombstone Courthouse State Historic Park</a>, which was created following the events of 1881; and the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Good Enough Silver Mine</a>, an 1880s silver mine that now provides tours.</p><p>To get a good historic overview of Tombstone, consider signing up for the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Good Enough Mine Trolley Tour</a>, where you'll see 55 landmarks, or a <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>nighttime ghost tour</a>.</p><h3>5. Florence, Arizona</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/florence-arizona.jpg><p>Halfway between Phoenix and Tucson, Florence is another Arizona town that retains its Wild West roots. According to <strong>Jen Luria</strong> of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Dog Cat Mouse Media</a>, which represents the city, Florence is home to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>oldest junior rodeo</a> in the U.S. (it takes place every November) and many locals are craftspeople and ranchers who are "living rugged, inspired lifestyles."</p><p>Florence was established in 1866, according to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Chamber of Commerce</a>, but in 1875 it became the Pinal County seat and a silver boom town. Today, nearly the entire town is a National Historic District, with 25 buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Along Main Street, you'll find old commercial buildings and saloons that are now shops and restaurants. And throughout, you'll see <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Sonoran homes</a>, an architectural style that dates back to the 1840s when this area was part of Mexico; they are one-story adobe rowhouses.</p><p>One attraction not to miss is <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>McFarland State Park</a>; it's home to the Pinal County Courthouse, which was originally a dance hall and later, a jailhouse, a hospital, and finally, a courthouse. Today, it's a historic museum. You might also want to stop by the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Tom Mix Monument</a>, which memorializes the early Western film star <strong>Tom Mix</strong>.</p><p><strong>For more travel advice delivered straight to your inbox,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><h3>6. Virginia City, Nevada</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/virginia-city-nevada.jpg><p>Virginia City, Nevada is best known for the Comstock Lode silver ore discovery in 1859. Those who visit today can explore this mining history with a ride on the&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Virginia & Truckee Railroad</a>, "the most famous American Short Line railroad," according to <strong>Tracie Barnthouse</strong>, public relations manager at&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Travel Nevada</a>. You'll take a scenic trip to the neighboring city of Gold Hill, passing 17 historic mines on the way, several of which you can tour.</p><p>Staten also recommends taking a walk down C Street, "the National Historic Landmark that stretches through the downtown of the city, where authentic 1870s western buildings, businesses, saloons, and more remain unchanged." He says <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Gold Hill Hotel & Saloon</a> is definitely worth a visit, as it's the oldest hotel in the state and has one of the most authentic intact saloons.</p><p>A representative for the city notes that "docents often walk the streets in Victorian garb telling visitors of the history of the town." For more nostalgia, there are a slew of historic restaurants.</p><h3>7. Deadwood, South Dakota</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/deadwood-south-dakota-main-street.jpg><p>A small town just outside Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota, Deadwood was settled in 1876 as a gold mining village. "It became famous for its lawlessness in the late 1800s," explains <strong>Trysta Barwig</strong>, travel expert and founder of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://thistraveldream.com/&source=gmail&ust=1663356394372000&usg=AOvVaw0k2Xc7EPHc28zrgVlpeZO0" data-follow=true>This Travel Dream</a>.&nbsp;"The murder of <strong>Wild Bill Hickok</strong> in 1876 only added to its reputation."</p><p>Today, the entire town of Deadwood is a National Historic Landmark. Walk down Main Street and find "saloons, casinos, breweries, and even a shootout [reenactment]," say <strong>Mark and Kristen Morgan</strong>, creators of the travel, hiking, and photography blog <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://wherearethosemorgans.com/__;!!FrPt2g6CO4Wadw!eF_TkboaXQ2bdEmG9S_bEqegh3RSPkrjt-tkfb7mh8LtIjXhc65f7U8AqwfvGTCU1FTaDA$&source=gmail&ust=1663333410224000&usg=AOvVaw2YyAnUrAZN02KIkRxzX90m" data-follow=true>Where Are Those Morgans</a>.

Experience that side of things in all its glory in Medora, North Dakota. It's located just outside <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Theodore Roosevelt National Park</a>—so named because this is where President Theodore Roosevelt came to hunt bison.</p><p>"It's all about stepping back to the days when Theodore Roosevelt ranched here, when shootouts at the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Little Missouri Saloon</a> or the Roughrider were normal. Where the Little Missouri River cuts through the Badlands to give ranchers a route to reach civilization 60 miles away," says <strong>Mike Kopp</strong>, creator of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Beautiful Badlands</a>.</p><p>Some of the main attractions include the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>North Dakota Cowboy Hall of Fame</a>; the outdoor <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Medora Musical</a>, a country-western variety show complete with live horses and "a dramatic reenactment of Theodore Roosevelt's famous charge during the battle of San Juan Hill"; and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>horse trail rides</a> through the Badlands.</p><h3>9.

This is where it came from. "Dodge City, Kansas is a famous Wild West town that was founded in 1872 … It attracted a high number of gunfighters and brothel-owners and gained a reputation for being the wickedest town in the Old West," explains <strong>Larry Snider</strong>, VP of operations at <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://casago.com/&source=gmail&ust=1663361075705000&usg=AOvVaw2FjCpKqFOaFksTeTOHo5KA" data-follow=true>Casago Vacation Rentals</a>.

Also overseen by the NPS is the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Boot Hill Museum</a>, a preserved slice of an Old West town that's located on the site of the Boot Hill Cemetery. While here, Snider says to grab a drink at the Longbranch Saloon. He also says you can visit the original location of the "Deadline," the railroad tracks that served as a boundary for where guns could be carried.</p><h3>10.

Not far from the Canadian border, it's situated in the Methow Valley, next to Okanogan National Forest, and just east of the Cascade Mountains.</p><p>"It is a charming vacation destination that has been preserved as an 1850s Old West town with wooden boardwalks, boutique stores, and unique restaurants and bars," says <strong>Nathan Sado</strong>, travel writer for <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>All About Glamping</a>.

According to a representative for the city, this neighborhood was once the country's largest horse and cattle market. This history has been preserved, and today you'll find "saloon-style bars, leather goods and cowboy boot stores, weekly rodeos, and more."</p><p>The biggest attraction at the Stockyards is undoubtedly its twice-daily cattle drive, "where real cowboys lead the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Fort Worth Herd of Texas Longhorns</a> down East Exchange Avenue, reenacting the historic cattle drives of the past." Every part of the event is historically accurate.&nbsp;For more cowboy fun, check out the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Stockyards Championship Rodeo</a>, the world's only year-round rodeo, or the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame</a>.</p><p>Other popular stops include the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://johnwayne.com/experience/&source=gmail&ust=1663359232035000&usg=AOvVaw2v8PawBdIGcT6XVMl7e7Me" data-follow=true>John Wayne: An American Experience</a> museum; the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Stockyards Museum</a>, which is located in the historic Livestock Exchange Building; and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://billybobstexas.com/&source=gmail&ust=1663359232035000&usg=AOvVaw1YtmV4xl4nDTUFXlscslYC" data-follow=true>Billy Bob's Texas</a>, the world's largest honky tonk.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>As for where to stay, another city representative suggests the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Hotel Drover</a>.

"It started as a tent city for 500 railroad employees and developed into a tough cow town known for its large skies, big steaks, big barbecue establishments, and enormous volumes of oil."</p><p>Amarillo still puts on several prestigious rodeos, notes Johnson, as well as the annual <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Polk Street Cattle Drive</a>, "during which 60 Texas longhorns make their way through downtown Amarillo en route to the Tri-State Fairgrounds."</p><p><strong>Jennifer Darnell</strong> of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Life on Lavender Lane</a> calls out the Wild West-themed <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Big Texan Motel</a> and the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Big Texan Steakhouse</a>, "a kitschy, saloon-style steakhouse serving up slabs of steak." She says you'll also want to stop by <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Cadillac Ranch</a>, a funky roadside attraction that consists of 10 Cadillac cars half-buried at the angle of the Pyramids of Gaza, as well as <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Palo Duro Canyon State Park</a>, the second-largest canyon in the U.S.</p><h3>13.

Even though that was nearly two centuries ago, this town "still has its ranching traditions in the 21st century," notes Ly. "In&nbsp;Bandera, you may see blacksmiths at work, go to a honky-tonk saloon, or saddle up for contemporary cowboying at a functioning ranch."</p><p>There are three different rodeos in Bandera, the best known of which is the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=# data-follow=true>Bandera ProRodeo</a>.
