She was born on the 27th of January 1961 in Rockville Centre, located in Long Island, New York, United States of America. Her birth sign is Aquarius, and she was born into a Christian household who are devout Catholics. Karen is an American by nationality and of Puerto Rican descent.</p><p>She has not disclosed any information regarding the identities of her parents and siblings. But one thing Karen particularly noted is that she had a morally sound upbringing, which inculcated in her a deep sense of discipline right from a very tender age to date. Also, details of her educational history are not clear, but she is known to be a high school graduate</p><h2><strong>Karen Velez’s Marriage To Lee Majors Lasted From 1988 To 1994</strong></h2><p>Karen Valdez and her celebrity ex-husband, Lee Majors, were married for six years. There is no record of how and when the former couple met, but it is public knowledge that they tied the knot in 1988. At this time, Lee had already spent over two decades in his acting career.</p><p>Meanwhile, Karen is notably not one of the many celebrity spouses whose sole or major claim to the limelight is their partner’s already-established fame. In her own case, Velez had already become popular before she met Lee, remained popular while their marriage lasted, and also maintained her popularity even after their marriage crashed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/we.png><p>Karen and Lee were not open about their marriage even while it lasted, so nothing much could be said about how they lived. Meanwhile, their union produced three children: a daughter, Nikki Loren, and twin sons, Dane Luke and Trey Kulley. Karen’s daughter Nikki is following in her career path as a model and has also graced the covers of Playboy.</p><p>Just as their marriage was not in the public eye, Velez and Majors’ divorce also happened without public knowledge. It was after some years that records showed that they had long gone their separate ways in 1994. To date, nothing was stated or even speculated to be the reason for their split. And none of the parties involved made a comment about their breakup but individually moved on with their lives.</p><h3><strong>Both of Them Remarried After Their Divorce</strong></h3><p>After her marriage with Lee Majors crashed, Karen Valdez started dating a man identified as Vic Ventimiglia Jr. They got married in June 1999. Although nothing much was publicly known about her second marriage, news broke in 2014 that it had packed up after five years. They had no children together.</p><p>Meanwhile, while her union with Lee was her first attempt at marriage, it was Lee Majors’ third time. The Fall Guy star had previously married and divorced two times before meeting Karen. His first marriage was to Kathy Robinson from 1961 to 1964, and they share a son named Lee Majors II. Nine years later, Majors went on to marry a second wife, Farrah Fawcett, who was a famous actress.</p><p>Their marriage lasted from 1973 to 1982, but they had no children. It was after Farrah that he married Karen as a third wife. Eight years after their divorce, in 2002, Majors also went ahead to marry a fourth wife, Faith Noelle Cross, which has been his longest-lasting marriage. Faith and Majors have been married for more than two decades.</p><h2><strong>Lee Majors’ Ex-wife is a Former Playboy Model</strong></h2><p>Following her high school graduation, Valdez stormed into the modeling industry. She had nursed a passion for modeling from a young age, and at the age of 18, she gathered the courage to step out and pursue her dream with determination and zeal. Fortunately, and alongside her striking beauty, poise, and graceful demeanor, Velez was able to make a successful career in the modeling industry.</p><p>In December 1984, she was selected as Playboy Magazine’s Playmate of the Month. The following year, she was also selected as the Playmate of the Year. Karen Velez graced the cover of the issue of Playmate Review, which earned her more fame and popularity. In 1986, she appeared in the Playboy’s Cover Girls edition in the US.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/Velez.png alt="Karen Velez" width=700 height=445 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Karen Velez is most popular for magazine covers. In 1986, she was featured as the model for ‘The Right Note for Holiday Giving’ in the January issue of Playboy US. She also appeared in Playboy’s Nudes in October 1990.</p><p>Furthermore, Karen Valdez is a television personality, and her TV credits include footage and appearances in several documentaries such as Playboy Playmates of the Year: The 80’s in 1989, Playboy Video Magazine, Vol. 8’ in 1985, Playboy: Playmates Bustin’ Out’ in 2000, and Playboy: Wet & Wild’ in 1989. In 1986, People magazine honored her as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People.</p><h2><b>She is Now a Life Coach and Certified Hypnotherapist&nbsp;</b></h2><p>After several years of working as a top model and despite having found success in the industry, Karen Valdez, in the late 1990s, decided to switch to a completely different career, which is wellness and healing. She started studying hypnotism and, after a few years, earned a certificate as a hypnotherapist. Velez currently works as a life coach and certified hypnotherapist.</p><p>Since her marriage with Lee Majors ended, Karen Valdez has been keeping her personal life under wraps. Hence, her current relationship status, though tagged divorced, is not exactly clear. However, all that is known is that Karen Valdez, after retiring from modeling, has continued with her latest career as a life coach and Hypnotherapist. She is said to have recently opened a life coaching company.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0ecqaqZ6mXauyrbHZZpilpF2Wr7DB02ajnp1doq6ru9GsZJ6wXay2p7GO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ariana-grande-apologizes-for-startling-fans-with-brain-scan-it-was-meant-to-be-informative.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ariana Grande Apologizes For Startling Fans With Brain Scan It Was Meant To Be Informative</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./password-child-meaning-tiktok-explained-what-is-the-trend-about-official-definition.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Password Child Meaning TikTok Explained - What Is The Trend About?
