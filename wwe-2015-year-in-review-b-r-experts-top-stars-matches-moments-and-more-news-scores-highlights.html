At the end of 2014, there were some real questions about whether Rollins would manage to claw his way to the top; one year later, there’s little doubt he’s punched his ticket as a main eventer.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>CM:&nbsp;</strong>This decision is based on personal bias, but <strong>Cesaro</strong> was my favorite from the past year. He put on some amazing matches with several different Superstars, and the fact&nbsp;WWE didn’t capitalize on his popularity before he got injured in November is disappointing to say the least. When he heals and returns to the ring, management would be wise to give him a big push.</p><p><strong>AB:&nbsp;Seth Rollins</strong> just pips Kevin Owens and Dean Ambrose. He’s the undisputed big dog of WWE, and even though he’s absent through injury, his return is already being hugely anticipated. Rollins has the full package, and the sooner he’s back in WWE, the better it’ll be for all involved.</p><p><strong>RD:</strong>&nbsp;<span>The best indication of what <strong>Seth Rollins</strong> came to mean to WWE was how much of a gut punch it was when he blew his knee out. Suddenly, Raw felt like it lost its heart.&nbsp;</span><span>Rollins thrived as a heel, was reliable in and out of the ring and put on an impressive series of matches in 2015. It didn't matter if he was working against a 56-year-old Sting or the newly arrived Neville, excellence was assured each night. He made it clear he will be a centerpiece of WWE's next era.</span><br><strong id=docs-internal-guid-d22b45c1-ca15-7d03-82ab-05b32b88dda3></strong></p><p><span><strong>AM:&nbsp;Seth Rollins</strong> was the savior of the company for the majority of the year, which started off on rocky round with the crowd not embracing Roman Reigns. Rollins stepped in as the man who would commandeer much of the spotlight, and rightfully so. Without Rollins, this year would have had a completely different genetic makeup, and it's tough to imagine what that result would have been but easy to picture it being much worse off than what we got even at our darkest times.</span></p><p><strong>EB:</strong>&nbsp;This one will not be a popular choice with some, but to discredit&nbsp;<strong>Roman Reigns</strong>’ accomplishments in 2015 simply because you do not appreciate the character or the performer would be irresponsible. He kicked off the year with a Royal Rumble win, main evented WrestleMania 31, got a really good match out of Big Show at Extreme Rules and overcame scathing fan criticisms to earn their respect and win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship on the December 14 episode of Raw. For all the cries of “he can’t wrestle” that are in excess across the Internet, he was one of the most consistent workers in WWE this year. In many ways, he is a worker who looks unlike any other on the roster and, more importantly, main event ready. Whether he was at the top of the card or midway through it, he proved capable of earning the respect of the audience between bells, even if they turned on him shortly thereafter. No one had to endure the tumultuous year Reigns did, and the fact he has come out of it smelling like a rose is a testament to his tenacity and determination.<br><strong></strong></p><p><strong>JM: </strong>Wow, that was one helluva defense of the Roman Empire by Erik. Reigns did grow in 2015, but <strong>Seth Rollins</strong>&nbsp;made the main roster his personal playground. Every time he was in the ring, he elevated his opponent and gave the fans a great show. It’s tough to be a wrestler who's both loved and hated, but Rollins toed that line so well. The cash in at WrestleMania 31, breaking John Cena's nose and launching the greatest T-shirt of 2015, defending two titles on the same night. His absence through injury showed just how much he carried the roster. Get well, Seth. WWE needs you.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9oYWeBeHnWsJxmamBmgm7FxJqpZqGeYr%2BmwsiermaaomKyubzEq6usZaSkvW6%2F05qprGWdlsGktMSsZKannZq7tb%2BMmqWdZZ2kv6Y%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./80-worst-pick-up-lines-you-should-never-ever-use-if-you-want-to-bag-someone.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>80 worst pick up lines you should never, ever use if you want to bag someone</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./thomas-moretti-obituary-elmira-ny-moretti-s-restaurant-owner-s-death-details.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Thomas Moretti Obituary, Elmira NY Morettis Restaurant Owners Death Details</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./britney-spears-former-assistant-felicia-culotta-shares-thoughts-on-her-boyfriend-sam-asghari.html>Britney Spears' Former Assistant Felicia Culotta Shares Thoughts on Her Boyfriend Sam Asghari</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-s-season-pass-gets-you-an-extra-multiplayer-map-at-launch.html>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare's season pass gets you an extra multiplayer map at launch</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./charlotte-lawrence-bio-age-net-worth-height-single-nationality-wiki.html>Charlotte Lawrence - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Single, Nationality, Wiki</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./kick-it-notch-2-wds.html>Kick it ___ notch: 2 wds.</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dakota-johnson-finally-opens-up-what-it-was-like-to-make-fifty-shades-of-grey-spoiler-alert-it-wasn.html></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 SyncBlog.
